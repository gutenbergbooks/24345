<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I have had pleasure in editing this little book, not
only because it is the work of my youngest son, but
also because it contains the results of a good deal of
experience of life under novel aspects, as seen by
young, fresh, and observant eyes.</p>

<p>How the book came to be written is as follows:
The boy, whose two years' narrative forms the subject
of these pages, was at the age of sixteen seized with
inflammation of the lungs, from which he was recovering
so slowly and unsatisfactorily, that I was advised
by London physicians to take him from the business
he was then learning in Yorkshire, and send him on
a long sea voyage. Australia was recommended,
because of the considerable time occupied in making
the voyage by sailing ship, and also because of the
comparatively genial and uniform temperature while
at sea.</p>

<p>He was accordingly sent out to Melbourne by one
of Money Wigram's ships in the winter of 1868-9,
with directions either to return by the same ship or,
if the opportunity presented itself, to remain for a
time in the colony. It will be found, from his own
narrative that, having obtained some suitable employment,
he decided to adopt the latter course; and for a
period of about eighteen months he resided at Majorca,
an up-country township situated in the gold-mining
district of Victoria.</p>

<p>When his health had become re-established, he was
directed to return home, about the beginning of the
present year; and he resolved to make the return
voyage by the Pacific route, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Honolulu and San
Francisco, and to proceed from thence by railway
across the Rocky Mountains to New York.</p>

<p>While at sea, the boy kept a full log, intended for
the perusal of his relatives at home; and while on
land, he corresponded with them regularly and fully,
never missing a mail. He had not the remotest idea
that anything which he saw and described during his
absence would ever appear in a book. But since his
return, it has occurred to the Editor of these pages
that the information they contain will probably be
found interesting to a wider circle of readers than
that to which the letters were originally addressed;
and in that belief, the substance of them is here reproduced,
the Editor's work having consisted mainly in
arranging the materials, leaving the writer to tell his
own story as much as possible in his own way, and in
his own words.</p>

<p><i>20th February: At Gravesend.</i>&mdash;My last farewells are
over, my last adieus are waved to friends on shore, and
I am alone on board the ship 'Yorkshire,' bound for
Melbourne. Everything is in confusion on board. The
decks are littered with stores, vegetables, hen-coops,
sheep-pens, and coils of rope. There is quite a little
crowd of sailors round the capstan in front of the cabin
door. Two officers, with lists before them, are calling
over the names of men engaged to make up our
complement of hands, and appointing them to their
different watches.</p>

<p>Though the ship is advertised to sail this evening,
the stores are by no means complete. The steward is
getting in lots of cases; and what a quantity of pickles!
Hens are coming up to fill the hen-coops. More sheep
are being brought; there are many on board already;
and here comes our milk-cow over the ship's side, gently
hoisted up by a rope. The animal seems amazed; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
she is in skilful hands. "Let go!" calls out the boatswain,
as the cow swings in mid-air; away rattles the
chain round the wheel of the donkey-engine, and the
break is put on just in time to land Molly gently on
the deck. In a minute she is snug in her stall
"for'ard," just by the cook's galley.</p>

<p>Passengers are coming on board. Here is one
mounting the ship's side, who has had a wet passage
from the shore. A seaman lends him a hand, and he
reaches the sloppy, slippery deck with difficulty.</p>

<p>It is a dismal day. The sleet and rain come driving
down. Everything is raw and cold; everybody wet or
damp. The passengers in wet mackintoshes, and the
seamen in wet tarpaulins; Gravesend, with its dirty
side to the river, and its dreary mud-bank exposed to
sight; the alternate drizzle and down-pour; the muddle
and confusion of the deck;&mdash;all this presented anything
but an agreeable picture to look at. So I
speedily leave the deck, in order to make a better
acquaintance with what is to be my home for the
next three months.</p>

<p>First, there is the saloon&mdash;long and narrow&mdash;surrounded
by the cabins. It is our dining-room, drawing-room,
and parlour, all in one. A long table occupies
the centre, fitted all round with fixed seats and reversible
backs. At one end of the table is the captain's
chair, over which hangs a clock and a barometer.
Near the after end of the saloon is the mizen-mast,
which passes through into the hole below, and rests
on the keelson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The cabins, which surround the saloon, are separated
from it by open woodwork, for purposes of ventilation.
The entrances to them from the saloon are by
sliding doors. They are separated from each other
by folding-doors, kept bolted on either side when one
cabin only is occupied; but these can be opened when
the neighbours on both sides are agreeable.</p>

<p>My own little cabin is by no means dreary or uninviting.
A window, with six small panes, lets in light
and air; and outside is a strong board, or "dead-light,"
for use in rough weather, to protect the glass. My
bunk, next to the saloon, is covered with a clean white
counterpane. A little wash-stand occupies the corner;
a shelf of favourite books is over my bed-head; and a
swing-lamp by its side. Then there is my little mirror,
my swing-tray for bottles, and a series of little bags
suspended from nails, containing all sorts of odds and
ends. In short, my little chamber, so fitted up, looks
quite cheerful and even jolly.</p>

<p>It grows dusk, and there is still the same bustle
and turmoil on deck. All are busy; everybody is in a
hurry. At about nine the noise seems to subside; and
the deck seems getting into something like order. As
we are not to weigh anchor until five in the morning,
some of the passengers land for a stroll on shore. I
decide to go to bed.</p>

<p>And now begins my first difficulty. I cannot find
room to extend myself, or even to turn. I am literally
"cribbed, cabined, and confined." Then there are the
unfamiliar noises outside,&mdash;the cackling of the ducks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the baa-ing of the sheep, the grunting of the pigs,&mdash;possibly
discussing the novelty of their position. And,
nearly all through the night, just outside my cabin,
two or three of the seamen sit talking together in
gruff undertones.</p>

<p>I don't think I slept much during my first night on
board. I was lying semi-conscious, when a loud voice
outside woke me up in an instant&mdash;"The anchor's up!
she's away!" I jumped up, and, looking out of my
little cabin window, peered out into the grey dawn.
The shores seemed moving, and we were off! I dressed
at once, and went on deck. But how raw and chill
it felt as I went up the companion-ladder. A little
steam-tug ahead of us was under weigh, with the
'Yorkshire' in tow. The deck was now pretty well
cleared, but white with frost; while the river banks
were covered with snow.</p>

<p>Other ships were passing down stream, each with its
tug; but we soon distanced them all, especially when
the men flung the sails to the wind, now blowing fresh.
At length, in about three-quarters of an hour, the
steamer took on board her tow-rope, and left us to
proceed on our voyage with a fair light breeze in our
favour, and all our canvas set.</p>

<p>When off the Nore, we hailed the 'Norfolk,' homeward
bound&mdash;a fast clipper ship belonging to the same
firm (Money Wigram's line),&mdash;and a truly grand sight
she was under full sail. There were great cheerings
and wavings of hats,&mdash;she passing up the river and
we out to sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>I need not detain you with a description of my
voyage down Channel. We passed in succession Margate,
Ramsgate, and Deal. The wind kept favourable
until we sighted Beachy Head, about half-past five in
the evening, and then it nearly died away. We were
off Brighton when the moon rose. The long stretch
of lights along shore, the clear star-lit sky, the bright
moon, the ship gently rocking in the almost calm sea,
the sails idly flapping against the mast,&mdash;formed a
picture of quiet during my first night at sea, which I
shall not soon forget.</p>

<p>But all this, I was told, was but "weather-breeding;"
and it was predicted that we were to have a change.
The glass was falling and we were to look out for
squalls. Nor were the squalls long in coming. Early
next morning I was roused by the noise on deck and
the rolling of things about my cabin floor. I had some
difficulty in dressing, not having yet found my sea
legs; but I succeeded in gaining the companion-ladder
and reaching the poop.</p>

<p>I found the wind had gone quite round in the night,
and was now blowing hard in our teeth, from the south-west.
It was to be a case of tacking down Channel,&mdash;a
slow and, for landsmen, a very trying process. In
the midst of my first <i>mal de mer</i>, I was amused by the
appearance on board of one of my fellow-passengers.
He was a small, a very small individual, but possessed
of a large stock of clothes, which he was evidently
glad to have an opportunity of exhibiting. He first
came up with a souwester on his head, the wrong end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
foremost, and a pair of canvas shoes on his feet,&mdash;a
sort of miniature Micawber, or first-class cockney
"salt," about to breast the briny. This small person's
long nose, large ears, and open mouth added to the
ludicrousness of his appearance. As the decks were
wet and the morning cold, he found the garb somewhat
unsuitable, and dived below, to come up again in strong
boots and a straw hat. But after further consideration,
he retired again, and again he appeared in fresh headgear&mdash;a
huge seal-skin cap with lappets coming down
over his ears. This important and dressy little individual
was a source of considerable amusement to us;
and there was scarcely an article in his wardrobe that
had not its turn during the day.</p>

<p>All night it blew a gale; the wind still from the
same quarter. We kept tacking between the coast of
England and the opposite coast of France, making but
small way as regards mileage,&mdash;the wind being right
in our teeth. During the night, each time that the
ship was brought round on the other tack, there was
usually a tremendous lurch; and sometimes an avalanche
of books descended upon me from the shelf
overhead. Yet I slept pretty soundly. Once I was
awakened by a tremendous noise outside&mdash;something
like a gun going off. I afterwards found it had been
occasioned by the mainsail being blown away to sea,
right out of the bolt-ropes, the fastenings of which
were immediately outside my cabin window.</p>

<p>When I went on deck the wind was still blowing
hard, and one had to hold on to ropes or cleats to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
be able to stand. The whole sea was alive, waves
chasing waves and bounding over each other, crested
with foam. Now and then the ship would pitch her
prow into a wave, even to the bulwarks, dash the billow
aside, and buoyantly rise again, bowling along, though
under moderate sail, because of the force of the gale.</p>

<p>The sea has some sad sights, of which one shortly
presented itself. About midday the captain sighted a
vessel at some distance off on our weather bow, flying
a flag of distress&mdash;an ensign upside down. Our ship
was put about, and as we neared the vessel we found she
had been abandoned, and was settling fast in the water.
Two or three of her sails were still set, torn to shreds
by the storm. The bulwarks were pretty much gone,
and here and there the bare stanchions, or posts, were
left standing, splitting in two the waves which broke
clear over her deck, lying almost even with the sea.
She turned out to be the 'Rosa,' of Guernsey, a fine
barque of 700 tons, and she had been caught and disabled
by the storm we had ourselves encountered. As
there did not seem to be a living thing on board, and
we could be of no use, we sailed away; and she must
have gone down shortly after we left her. Not far
from the sinking ship we came across a boat bottom
upwards, most probably belonging to the abandoned
ship. What of the poor seamen? Have they been
saved by other boats, or been taken off by some
passing vessel? If not, alas for their wives and
children at home! Indeed it was a sad sight.</p>

<p>But such things are soon forgotten at sea. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
too much occupied by our own experiences to think
much of others. For two more weary days we went
tacking about, the wind somewhat abating. Sometimes
we caught sight of the French coast through the mist;
and then we tacked back again. At length Eddystone
light came in view, and we knew we were not far from
the entrance to Plymouth Sound. Once inside the
Breakwater, we felt ourselves in smooth water again.</p>

<p>Going upon deck in the morning, I found our ship
anchored in the harbour nearly opposite Mount Edgcumbe.
Nothing could be more lovely than the sight
that presented itself. The noble bay, surrounded by
rocks, cliffs, cottages&mdash;Drake's Island, bristling with
cannon, leaving open a glimpse into the Hamoaze
studded with great hulks of old war-ships&mdash;the projecting
points of Mount Edgcumbe Park, carpeted
with green turf down to the water and fringed behind
by noble woods, looking like masses of emerald cut into
fret-work&mdash;then, in the distance, the hills of Dartmoor,
variegated with many hues, and swept with alternations
of light and shade&mdash;all these presented a picture, the
like of which I had never before seen and feel myself
quite incompetent to describe.</p>

<p>As we had to wait here for a fair wind, and the gale
was still blowing right into the harbour's mouth, there
seemed no probability of our setting sail very soon.
We had, moreover, to make up our complement of
passengers, and provisions. Those who had a mind
accordingly went on shore, strolled through the town,
and visited the Hoe, from which a magnificent view of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the harbour is obtained, or varied their bill of fare by
dining at an hotel.</p>

<p>We were, however, cautioned not to sleep on shore,
but to return to the ship for the night, and even during
the day to keep a sharp look-out for the wind; for,
immediately on a change to the nor'ard, no time would
be lost in putting out to sea. We were further informed
that, in the case of nearly every ship, passengers,
through their own carelessness and dilly-dallying on
shore, had been left behind. I determined, therefore,
to stick to the ship.</p>

<p>After three days' weary waiting, the wind at last went
round; the anchor was weighed with a willing "Yo!
heave ho!" and in a few hours, favoured by a fine light
breeze, we were well out to sea, and the brown cliffs of
Old England gradually faded away in the distance.</p>

<p><i>3rd March</i>.&mdash;Like all passengers, I suppose, who come
together on board ship for a long voyage, we had scarcely
passed the Eddystone Lighthouse before we began to
take stock of each other. Who is this? What is he?
Why is he going out? Such were the questions we
inwardly put to ourselves and sought to answer.</p>

<p>I found several, like myself, were making the voyage
for their health. A long voyage by sailing ship seems
to have become a favourite prescription for lung complaints;
and it is doubtless an honest one, as the doctor
who gives it at the same time parts with his patient
and his fees. But the advice is sound; as the long
rest of the voyage, the comparatively equable temperature
of the sea air, and probably the improved
quality of the atmosphere inhaled, are all favourable
to the healthy condition of the lungs as well as of the
general system.</p>

<p>Of those going out in search of health, some were
young and others middle-aged. Amongst the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was a patient, gentle sufferer, racked by a hacking
cough when he came on board. Another, a young
passenger, had been afflicted by abscess in his throat
and incipient lung-disease. A third had been worried
by business and afflicted in his brain, and needed a
long rest. A fourth had been crossed in love, and
sought for change of scene and occupation.</p>

<p>But there were others full of life and health among
the passengers, going out in search of fortune or of
pleasure. Two stalwart, outspoken, manly fellows, who
came on board at Plymouth, were on their way to New
Zealand to farm a large tract of land. They seemed
to me to be models of what colonial farmers should be.
Another was on his way to take up a run in Victoria,
some 250 miles north of Melbourne. He had three fine
Scotch colley dogs with him, which were the subject of
general admiration.</p>

<p>We had also a young volunteer on board, who had
figured at Brighton reviews, and was now on his way to
join his father in New Zealand, where he proposed to
join the colonial army. We had also a Yankee gentleman,
about to enter on his governorship of the Guano
Island of Maldon, in the Pacific, situated almost due
north of the Society Islands, said to have been purchased
by an English company.</p>

<p>Some were going out on "spec." If they could find
an opening to fortune, they would settle; if not, they
would return. One gentleman was taking with him a
fine portable photographic apparatus, intending to visit
New Zealand and Tasmania, as well as Australia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Others were going out for indefinite purposes. The
small gentleman, for instance, who came on board at
Gravesend with the extensive wardrobe, was said to
be going out to Australia to grow,&mdash;the atmosphere
and climate of the country being reported as having a
wonderful effect on growth. Another entertained me
with a long account of how he was leaving England
because of his wife; but, as he was of a somewhat
priggish nature, I suspect the fault may have been his
own as much as hers.</p>


<p>And then there was the Major, a military and distinguished-looking
gentleman, who came on board, accompanied
by a couple of shiny new trunks, at Plymouth.
He himself threw out the suggestion that the raising
of a colonial volunteer army was the grand object of
his mission. Anyhow, he had the manners of a gentleman.
And he had seen service, having lost his right
arm in the Crimea and gone all through the Indian
Mutiny war with his left. He was full of fun, always
in spirits, and a very jolly fellow, though rather given
to saying things that would have been better left
unsaid.</p>

<p>Altogether, we have seventeen saloon passengers on
board, including the captain's wife, the only lady at
the poop end. There were also probably about eighty
second and third-class passengers in the forward parts
of the ship.</p>

<p>Although the wind was fair, and the weather fine,
most of the passengers suffered more or less from seasickness;
but at length, becoming accustomed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
motion of the ship, they gradually emerged from their
cabins, came on deck, and took part in the daily life
on board. Let me try and give a slight idea of what
this is.</p>

<p>At about six every morning we are roused by the
sailors holystoning the decks, under the superintendence
of the officer of the watch. A couple of middies
pump up water from the sea, by means of a pump
placed just behind the wheel. It fills the tub until it
overflows, running along the scuppers of the poop, and
out on to the main-deck through a pipe. Here the
seamen fill their buckets, and proceed with the scouring
of the main-deck. Such a scrubbing and mopping!</p>

<p>I need scarcely explain that holystone is a large soft
stone, used with water, for scrubbing the dirt off the
ship's decks. It rubs down with sand; the sand is
washed off by buckets of water thrown down, all is
well mopped, and the deck is then finished off with
India-rubber squilgees.</p>

<p>The poop is always kept most bright and clean.
Soon after we left port it assumed a greatly-improved
appearance. The boards began to whiten with the
holystoning. Not a grease-mark or spot of dirt was to
be seen. All was polished off with hand-scrapers. On
Sundays the ropes on the poop were all neatly coiled,
man-of-war fashion&mdash;not a bight out of place. The
brasswork was kept as bright as a gilt button.</p>

<p>By the time the passengers dressed and went on
deck the cleaning process was over, and the decks were
dry. After half an hour's pacing the poop the bell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
would ring for breakfast, the appetite for which would
depend very much upon the state of the weather and
the lurching of the ship. Between breakfast and lunch,
more promenading on the poop; the passengers sometimes,
if the weather was fine, forming themselves in
groups on deck, cultivating each other's acquaintance.</p>

<p>During our first days at sea we had some difficulty
in finding our sea legs. The march of some up and
down the poop was often very irregular, and occasionally
ended in disaster. Yet the passengers were
not the only learners; for, one day, we saw one of the
cabin-boys, carrying a heavy ham down the steps from
a meat-safe on board, miss his footing in a lurch of the
ship, and away went our fine ham into the lee-scuppers,
spoilt and lost.</p>

<p>We lunched at twelve. From thence, until dinner
at five, we mooned about on deck as before, or visited
sick passengers, or read in our respective cabins, or
passed the time in conversation; and thus the day
wore on. After dinner the passengers drew together
in parties and became social. In the pleasantly-lit
saloon some of the elder subsided into whist, while
the juniors sought the middies in their cabin on the
main-deck, next door to the sheep-pen; there they
entertained themselves and each other with songs,
accompanied by the concertina and clouds of tobacco-smoke.</p>

<p>The progress of the ship was a subject of constant
interest. It was the first thing in the morning and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the last at night; and all through the day, the direction
of the wind, the state of the sky and the weather,
and the rate we were going at, were the uppermost
topics of conversation.</p>

<p>When we left port the wind was blowing fresh on
our larboard quarter from the north-east, and we made
good progress across the Bay of Biscay; but, like many
of our passengers, I was too much occupied by private
affairs to attend to the nautical business going on upon
deck. All I know was, that the wind was fair, and that
we were going at a good rate. On the fourth day, I
found we were in the latitude of Cape Finisterre, and
that we had run 168 miles in the preceding 24 hours.
From this time forward, having got accustomed to
the motion of the ship, I felt sufficiently well to be
on deck early and late, watching the handling of the
ship.</p>

<p>It was a fine sight to look up at the cloud of canvas
above, bellied out by the wind, like the wings of a
gigantic bird, while the ship bounded through the
water, dashing it in foam from her bows, and sometimes
dipping her prow into the waves, and sending
aloft a shower of spray.</p>

<p>There was always something new to admire in the
ship, and the way in which she was handled: as, for
instance, to see the topgallant sails hauled down when
the wind freshened, or a staysail set as the wind went
round to the east. The taking in of the mainsail on a
stormy night was a thing to be remembered for life:
twenty-four men on the great yard at a time, clewing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
it in to the music of the wind whistling through the
rigging. The men sing out cheerily at their work,
the one who mounts the highest, or stands the foremost
on the deck; usually taking the lead&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hawl on the bowlin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The jolly ship's a-rollin&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hawl on the bowlin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And we'll all drink rum.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In comes the rope with a "Yo! heave ho!" and a jerk,
until the "belay" sung out by the mate signifies that
the work is done. Then, there is the scrambling on
the deck when the wind changes quarter, and the yards
want squaring as the wind blows more aft. Such are
among the interesting sights to be seen on deck when
the wind is in her tantrums at sea.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the wind was blowing quite aft. Our
run during the twenty-four hours was 172 miles. Thermometer
58&deg;. The captain is in hopes of a most
favourable run to the Cape. It is our first Sunday on
board, and at 10.30 the bell rings for service, when the
passengers of all classes assemble in the saloon. The
alternate standing and kneeling during the service is
rather uncomfortable, the fixed seats jamming the legs,
and the body leaning over at an unpleasant angle
when the ship rolls, which she frequently does, and
rather savagely.</p>

<p>Going upon deck next morning, I found the wind
blowing strong from the north, and the ship going
through the water at a splendid pace. As much sail
was on as she could carry, and she dashed along, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a broad track of foam in her wake. The captain is in
high glee at the speed at which we are going. "A fine
run down to the Line!" he says, as he walks the poop,
smiling and rubbing his hands; while the middies are
enthusiastic in praises of the good ship, "walking the
waters like a thing of life." The spirits of all on board
are raised by several degrees. We have the pleasure of
feeling ourselves bounding forward, on towards the
sunny south. There is no resting, but a constant
pressing onward, and, as we look over the bulwarks,
the waves, tipped by the foam which our ship has
raised, seem to fly behind us at a prodigious speed.
At midday we find the ship's run during the twenty-four
hours has been 280 miles&mdash;a splendid day's work,
almost equal to steam!</p>

<p>We are now in latitude 39&deg; 16', about due east of
the Azores. The air is mild and warm; the sky is
azure, and the sea intensely blue. How different from
the weather in the English Channel only a short week
ago! Bugs are now discarded, and winter clothing
begins to feel almost oppressive. In the evenings, as
we hang over the taffrail, we watch with interest the
bluish-white sparks mingling with the light blue foam
near the stern&mdash;the first indications of that phosphorescence
which, I am told, we shall find so bright
in the tropics.</p>

<p>An always interesting event at sea is the sighting of
a distant ship. To-day we signalled the 'Maitland,'
of London, a fine ship, though she was rolling a great
deal, beating up against the wind that was impelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
us so prosperously forward. I hope she will report us
on arrival, to let friends at home know we are so far
all right on our voyage.</p>

<p>The wind still continues to blow in our wake, but
not so strongly; yet we make good progress. The
weather keeps very fine. The sky seems to get clearer,
the sea bluer, and the weather more brilliant, and even
the sails look whiter, as we fly south. About midday
on the eighth day after leaving Plymouth we are in
the latitude of Madeira, which we pass about forty
miles distant.</p>

<p>As the wind subsides, and the novelty of being on
shipboard wears off, the passengers begin to think of
amusements. One cannot be always reading; and, as
for study, though I try Spanish and French alternately,
I cannot settle to them, and begin to think that life on
shipboard is not very favourable for study. We play
at quoits&mdash;using quoits of rope&mdash;on the poop, for a good
part of the day. But this soon becomes monotonous;
and we begin to consider whether it may not be possible
to get up some entertainment on board to make the
time pass pleasantly. We had a few extempore concerts
in one of the middies' berths. The third-class
passengers got up a miscellaneous entertainment, including
recitals, which went off very well. One of the
tragic recitations was so well received that it was
encored. And thus the time was whiled away, while
we still kept flying south.</p>

<p>On the ninth day we are well south of Madeira.
The sun is so warm at midday that an awning is hung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
over the deck, and the shade it affords is very grateful.
We are now in the trade-winds, which blow pretty
steadily at this part of our course in a south-westerly
direction, and may generally be depended upon until
we near the Equator. At midday of the tenth day I
find we have run 180 miles in the last twenty-four
hours, with the wind still steady on our quarter. We
have passed Teneriffe, about 130 miles distant&mdash;too
remote to see it&mdash;though I am told that, had we been
twenty miles nearer, we should probably have seen
the famous peak.</p>

<p>To while away the time, and by way of a little
adventure, I determined at night to climb the mizen-mast
with a fellow-passenger. While leaving the deck
I was chalked by a middy, in token that I was in for
my footing, so as to be free of the mizen-top. I succeeded
in reaching it safely, though to a green hand,
as I was, it looks and really feels somewhat perilous at
first. I was sensible of the feeling of fear or apprehension
just at the moment of getting over the cross-trees.
Your body hangs over in mid-air, at a terrible incline
backwards, and you have to hold on like anything for
just one moment, until you get your knee up into the
top. The view of the ship under press of canvas from
the mizen-top is very grand; and the phosphorescence
in our wake, billow upon billow of light shining foam,
seemed more brilliant than ever.</p>

<p>The wind again freshens, and on the eleventh day we
make another fine run of 230 miles. It is becoming
rapidly warmer, and we shall soon be in the region of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
bonitos, albatrosses, and flying fish&mdash;only a fortnight
after leaving England!</p>

<p>Our second Sunday at sea was beautiful exceedingly.
We had service in the saloon as usual; and, after
church, I climbed the mizen, and had half an hour's
nap on the top. Truly this warm weather, and monotonous
sea life, seems very favourable for dreaming, and
mooning, and loafing. In the evening there was some
very good hymn-singing in the second-class cabin.</p>

<p>Early next morning, when pacing the poop, we were
startled by the cry from the man on the forecastle of
"Land ho!" I found, by the direction of the captain's
eyes, that the land seen lay off our weather-beam.
But, though I strained my eyes looking for the land, I
could see nothing. It was not for hours that I could
detect it; and then it looked more like a cloud than
anything else. At length the veil lifted, and I saw the
land stretching away to the eastward. It was the island
of San Antonio, one of the Cape de Verds.</p>

<p>As we neared the land, and saw it more distinctly,
it looked a grand object. Though we were then some
fifteen miles off, yet the highest peaks, which were
above the clouds, some thousands of feet high, were so
clear and so beautiful that they looked as if they had
been stolen out of the 'Arabian Nights,' or some fairy
tale of wonder and beauty.</p>

<p>The island is said to be alike famous for its oranges
and pretty girls. Indeed the Major, who is very good
at drawing the long bow, declared that he could see a
very interesting female waving her hand to him from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a rock! With the help of the telescope we could
certainly see some of the houses on shore.</p>

<p>As this is the last land we are likely to see until
we reach Australia, we regard it with all the greater
interest; and I myself watched it in the twilight until
it faded away into a blue mist on the horizon.</p>

Yankee Whaler</span>.</p>


<p><i>17th March</i>.&mdash;We are now fairly within the tropics.
The heat increases day by day. This morning, at
eight, the temperature was 87&deg; in my cabin. At midday,
with the sun nearly overhead, it is really hot.
The sky is of a cloudless azure, with a hazy appearance
towards the horizon. The sea is blue, dark, deep blue&mdash;and
calm.</p>

<p>Now we see plenty of flying-fish. Whole shoals of
the glittering little things glide along in the air, skimming
the tops of the waves. They rise to escape their
pursuers, the bonitos, which rush after them, showing
their noses above the water now and then. But the
poor flying-fish have their enemies above the waters
as well as under them; for they no sooner rise than
they risk becoming the prey of the ocean birds, which
are always hovering about and ready to pounce upon
them. It is a case of "out of the frying-pan into the
fire." They fly further than I thought they could. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
saw one of them to-day fly at least sixty yards, and
sometimes they mount so high as to reach the poop,
some fifteen feet from the surface of the water.</p>

<p>One of the most pleasant events of the day is the
morning bath on board. You must remember the
latitude we are in. We are passing along, though not
in sight of, that part of the African coast where a
necklace is considered full dress. We sympathise
with the natives, for we find clothes becoming intolerable;
hence our enjoyment of the morning bath,
which consists in getting into a large tub on board
and being pumped upon by the hose. Pity that one
cannot have it later, as it leaves such a long interval
between bath and breakfast; but it freshens one up
wonderfully, and is an extremely pleasant operation. I
only wish that the tub were twenty times as large,
and the hose twice as strong.</p>

<p>The wind continues in our favour, though gradually
subsiding. During the last two days we have run over
200 miles each day; but the captain says that by the
time we reach the Line the wind will have completely
died away. To catch a little of the breeze, I go up the
rigging to the top. Two sailors came up mysteriously,
one on each side of the ratlines. They are terrible
fellows for making one pay "footings," and their object
was to intercept my retreat downwards. When they
reached me, I tried to resist; but it was of no use. I
must be tied to the rigging unless I promised the customary
bottle of rum; so I gave in with a good grace,
and was thenceforward free to take an airing aloft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The amusements on deck do not vary much. Quoits,
cards, reading, and talking, and sometimes a game of
romps, such as "Walk, my lady, walk!" We have
tried to form a committee, with a view to getting up
some Penny Reading or theatrical entertainment, and
to ascertain whether there be any latent talent aboard;
but the heat occasions such a languor as to be very
unfavourable for work, and the committee lay upon
their oars, doing nothing.</p>

<p>One of our principal sources of amusement is the
Major. He is unfailing. His drawings of the long bow
are as good as a theatrical entertainment. If any one
tells a story of something wonderful, he at once "caps
it," as they say in Yorkshire, by something still more
wonderful. One of the passengers, who had been at
Calcutta, speaking of the heat there, said it was so
great as to make the pitch run out of the ship's sides.
"Bah!" said the Major, "that is nothing to what it is
in Ceylon; there the heat is so great as to melt the
soldiers' buttons off on parade, and then their jackets
all get loose."</p>

<p>It seems that to-day (the 17th) is St. Patrick's Day.
This the Major, who is an Irishman, discovered only
late in the evening, when he declared he would have
"given a fiver" if he had only known it in the morning.
But, to make up for lost time, he called out forthwith,
"Steward! whisky!" and he disposed of some seven
or eight glasses in the saloon before the lamps were
put out; after which he adjourned to one of the cabins,
and there continued the celebration of St. Patrick's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Day until about two o'clock in the morning. On getting
up rather late, he said to himself, loud enough for me
to overhear in my cabin, "Well, George, my boy,
you've done your duty to St. Patrick; but he's left
you a horrible bad headache!" And no wonder.</p>

<p>At last there is a promised novelty on board. Some
original Christy's Minstrels are in rehearsal, and the
Theatrical Committee are looking up amateurs for a
farce. Readings from Dickens are also spoken of. An
occasional whale is seen blowing in the distance, and
many grampuses come rolling about the ship,&mdash;most
inelegant brutes, some three or four times the size of
a porpoise. Each in turn comes up, throws himself
round on the top of the sea, exposing nearly half his
body, and then rolls off again.</p>

<p>To-day (the 20th March) we caught our first fish
from the forecastle,&mdash;a bonito, weighing about seven
pounds. Its colour was beautifully variegated: on the
back dark blue, with a streak of light blue silver
on either side, and the belly silvery white. These fish
are usually caught from the jiboom and the martingale,
as they play about the bows of the ship. The
only bait is a piece of white rag, which is bobbed upon
the surface of the water to imitate a flying-fish.</p>

<p>But what interests us more than anything else at
present is the discovery of some homeward-bound ship,
by which to despatch our letters to friends at home.
The captain tells us that we are now almost directly in
the track of vessels making for England from the south;
and that if we do not sight one in the course of a day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
or two, we may not have the chance of seeing another
until we are far on our way south&mdash;if it all. We are,
therefore, anxiously waiting for the signal of a ship in
sight; and, in the hope that one may appear, we are
all busily engaged in the saloon giving the finishing
touches to our home letters.</p>

<p>Shortly after lunch the word was given that no less
than three ships were in sight. Immense excitement
on board! Everybody turned up on deck. Passengers
who had never been seen since leaving Plymouth, now
made their appearance to look out for the ships. One
of them was a steamer, recognizable by the line of
smoke on the horizon, supposed to be the West India
mail-boat; another was outward-bound, like ourselves;
and the third was the homeward-bound ship for which
we were all on the look-out. She lay right across our
bows, but was still a long way off. As we neared her,
betting began among the passengers, led by the Major,
as to whether she would take letters or not. The scene
became quite exciting. The captain ordered all who
had letters to be in readiness. I had been scribbling
my very hardest ever since the ships came in sight,
and now I closed my letter and sealed it up. Would
the ship take our letters? Yes! She is an English
ship, with an English flag at her peak; and she signals
for newspapers, preserved milk, soap, and a doctor!</p>

<p>I petitioned for leave to accompany the doctor, and,
to my great delight, was allowed to do so. The wind
had nearly gone quite down, and only came in occasional
slight gusts. The sea was, therefore, comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
calm, with only a long, slow swell; yet, even
though calm, there is some little difficulty in getting
down into a boat in mid-ocean. At one moment the
boat is close under you, and at the next she is some
four yards down, and many feet apart from the side of
the ship; you have, therefore, to be prompt in seizing
an opportunity, and springing on board just at the
right moment.</p>

<p>As we moved away from the 'Yorkshire,' with a
good bundle of newspapers and the other articles signalled
for, and looked back upon our ship, she really
looked a grand object on the waters. The sun shone
full upon her majestic hull, her bright copper now and
then showing as she slowly rose and sank on the long
swell. Above all were her towers of white canvas,
standing out in relief against the leaden-coloured sky.
Altogether, I don't think I have ever seen a more
magnificent sight. As we parted from the ship, the
hundred or more people on board gave us a ringing
cheer.</p>

<p>Our men now pulled with a will towards the still-distant
ship. As we neared her, we observed that
she must have encountered very heavy weather, as
part of her foremast and mainmast had been carried
away. Her sides looked dirty and worn, and all her
ironwork was rusty, as if she had been a long time at
sea. She proved to be the 'Lord Raglan,' of about
800 tons, bound from Bankok, in Siam, to Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The captain was delighted to see us, and gave us
a most cordial welcome. He was really a very nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
fellow, and was kindness itself. He took us down to
his cabin, and treated us to Chinese beer and cigars.
The place was cheerful and comfortable-looking, and
fitted up with Indian and Chinese curiosities; yet I
could scarcely reconcile myself to living there. There
was a dreadful fusty smell about, which, I am told, is
peculiar to Indian and Chinese ships. The vessel was
laden with rice, and the fusty heat which came up
from below was something awful.</p>

<p>The 'Lord Raglan' had been nearly two years
from London. She had run from London to Hong-Kong,
and had since been engaged in trading between
there and Siam. She was now eighty-three days from
Bankok. In this voyage she had encountered some
very heavy weather, in which she had sprung her
foremast, which was now spliced up all round. What
struck me was the lightness of her spars and the
smallness of her sails, compared with ours. Although
her mainmast is as tall, it is not so thick as our mizen,
and her spars are very slender above the first top.
Yet the 'Raglan,' in her best days, used to be one
of the crack Melbourne clipper ships.</p>

<p>The kindly-natured captain was most loth to let us
go. It was almost distressing to see the expedients he
adopted to keep us with him for a few minutes longer.
But it was fast growing dusk, and in the tropics it
darkens almost suddenly; so we were at last obliged
to tear ourselves away, and leave him with his soap,
milk, and newspapers. He, on his part, sent by us a
twenty-pound chest of tea, as a present for the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
mate (who was with us) and the captain. As we left
the ship's side we gave the master and crew of the
'Raglan' a hearty "three times three." All this while
the two vessels had been lying nearly becalmed, so
that we had not a very long pull before we were safely
back on board our ship.</p>

<p>For about five days we lie nearly idle, making very
little progress, almost on the Line. The trade-winds
have entirely left us. The heat is tremendous&mdash;130&deg;
in the sun; and at midday, when the sun is right overhead,
it is difficult to keep the deck. Towards evening
the coolness is very pleasant; and when rain falls, as
it can only fall in the tropics, we rush out to enjoy
the bath. We assume the thinnest of <i>bizarre</i> costumes,
and stand still under the torrent, or vary the pleasure
by emptying buckets over each other.</p>

<p>We are now in lat. 0&deg; 22', close upon the Equator.
Though our sails are set, we are not sailing, but only
floating: indeed, we seem to be drifting. On looking
round the horizon, I count no fewer than sixteen ships
in sight, all in the same plight as ourselves. We are
drawn together by an under-current or eddy, though
scarcely a breath of wind is stirring. We did not,
however, speak any of the ships, most of them being
comparatively distant.</p>

<p>We cross the Line about 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on the twentieth day
from Plymouth. We have certainly had a very fine
run thus far, slow though our progress now is, for we
are only going at the rate of about a mile an hour;
but when we have got a little further south, we expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to get out of the tropical calms and catch the southeast
trade-winds.</p>

<p>On the day following, the 24th March, a breeze
sprang up, and we made a run of 187 miles. We have
now passed the greatest heat, and shortly expect cooler
weather. Our spirits rise with the breeze, and we again
begin to think of getting up some entertainments on
board; for, though we have run some 4,800 miles from
Plymouth, we have still some fifty days before us ere
we expect to see Melbourne.</p>

<p>One thing that strikes me much is the magnificence
of the tropical sunsets. The clouds assume all sorts of
fantastic shapes, and appear more solid and clearly
defined than I have ever seen before. Towards evening
they seem to float in colour&mdash;purple, pink, red, and
yellow alternately&mdash;while the sky near the setting sun
seems of a beautiful green, gradually melting into the
blue sky above. The great clouds on the horizon look
like mountains tipped with gold and fiery red. One of
these sunsets was a wonderful sight. The sun went
down into the sea between two enormous clouds&mdash;the
only ones to be seen&mdash;and they blazed with the brilliant
colours I have described, which were constantly
changing, until the clouds stood out in dark relief
against the still delicately-tinted sky. I got up frequently
to see the sun rise, but in the tropics it is not
nearly so fine at its rising as at its setting.</p>

<p>A ship was announced as being in sight, with a signal
flying to speak with us. We were sailing along under
a favourable breeze, but our captain put the ship about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and waited for the stranger. It proved to be a Yankee
whaler. When the captain came on board, he said
"he guessed he only wanted newspapers." Our skipper
was in a "roaring wax" at being stopped in his course
for such a trivial matter, but he said nothing. The
whaler had been out four years, and her last port was
Honolulu in the Sandwich Islands. The Yankee captain,
amongst other things, wanted to know if Grant was
President, and if the 'Alabama' question was settled;
he was interested in the latter question, as the 'Alabama'
had burnt one of his ships. He did not seem
very comfortable while on board, and when he had
got his papers he took his leave. I could not help admiring
the whale-boat in which he was rowed back to
his own vessel. It was a beautiful little thing, though
dirty; but, it had doubtless seen much service. It was
exquisitely modelled, and the two seamen in the little
craft handled it to perfection. How they contrived to
stand up in it quite steady, while the boat, sometimes
apparently half out of the water, kept rising and falling
on the long ocean-swell, seemed to me little short of
marvellous.</p>

Rescue</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Distressing Scene on Board the 'Pyrmont</span>.'</p>


<p><i>1st. April</i>.&mdash;I was roused early this morning by the
cry outside of "Get up! get up! There is a ship on
fire ahead!" I got up instantly, dressed, and hastened
on deck, like many more. But there was no ship on
fire; and then we laughed, and remembered that it
was All Fools' Day.</p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon we descried a sail, and
shortly after we observed that she was bearing down
upon us. The cry of "Letters for home!" was raised,
and we hastened below to scribble a few last words,
close our letters, and bring them up for the letter-bag.</p>

<p>By this time the strange ship had drawn considerably
nearer, and we saw that she was a barque, heavily
laden. She proved to be the 'Pyrmont,' a German
vessel belonging to Hamburg, but now bound for
Yarmouth from Iquique, with a cargo of saltpetre on
board. When she came near enough to speak to us,
our captain asked, "What do you want?" The answer
was, "'Blue Jacket' burnt at sea; her passengers on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
board. Have you a doctor?" Here was a sensation!
Our April Fools' alarm was true after all. A vessel
<i>had</i> been on fire, and here were the poor passengers
asking for help. We knew nothing of the 'Blue
Jacket,' but soon we were to know all.</p>

<p>A boat was at once lowered from the davits, and
went off with the doctor and the first mate. It was
a hazy, sultry, tropical day, with a very slight breeze
stirring, and very little sea. Our main-yard was backed
to prevent our further progress, and both ships lay-to
within a short distance of each other. We watched
our boat until we saw the doctor and officer mount the
'Pyrmont,' and then waited for further intelligence.</p>

<p>Shortly after we saw our boat leaving the ship's side,
and as it approached we observed that it contained
some strangers, as well as our doctor, who had returned
for medicines, lint, and other appliances. When the
strangers reached the deck we found that one of them
was the first officer of the unfortunate 'Blue Jacket,'
and the other one of the burnt-out passengers. The
latter, poor fellow, looked a piteous sight. He had
nothing on but a shirt and pair of trowsers; his hair
was matted, his face haggard, his eyes sunken. He
was without shoes, and his feet were so sore that he
could scarcely walk without support.</p>

<p>And yet it turned out that this poor suffering fellow
was one of the best-conditioned of those who had been
saved from the burnt ship. He told us how that the
whole of the fellow-passengers whom he had just left
on board the 'Pyrmont' wanted clothes, shirts, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
shoes, and were in a wretched state, having been tossed
about at sea in an open boat for about nine days, during
which they had suffered the extremities of cold, thirst,
and hunger.</p>

<p>We were horrified by the appearance, and still more
by the recital, of the poor fellow. Every moment he
astonished us by new details of horror. But it was of
no use listening to more. We felt we must do something.
All the passengers at once bestirred themselves,
and went into their cabins to seek out any clothing
they could spare for the relief of the sufferers. I found
I could give trowsers, shirts, a pair of drawers, a blanket,
and several pocket-handkerchiefs; and as the other
passengers did likewise, a very fair bundle was soon
made up and sent on board the 'Pyrmont.'</p>

<p>Of course we were all eager to know something of
the details of the calamity which had befallen the
'Blue Jacket.' It was some time before we learnt them
all; but as two of the passengers&mdash;who had been gold-diggers
in New Zealand&mdash;were so good as to write out
a statement for the doctor, the original of which now
lies before me, I will endeavour, in as few words as I
can, to give you some idea of the burning of the ship
and the horrible sufferings of the passengers.</p>

<p>The 'Blue Jacket' sailed from Port Lyttleton, New
Zealand, for London on the 13th February, 1869, laden
with wool, cotton, flax, and 15,000 ounces of gold.
There were seven first-cabin passengers and seventeen
second-cabin. The ship had a fine run to Cape Horn
and past the Falkland Islands. All went well until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the 9th March, when in latitude 50&deg; 26' south, one of
the seamen, about midday, observed smoke issuing
from the fore-hatchhouse. The cargo was on fire! All
haste was made to extinguish it. The fire-engines
were set to work, passengers as well as crew working
with a will, and at one time it seemed as if the fire
would be got under. The hatch was opened and the
second mate attempted to go down, with the object of
getting up and throwing overboard the burning bales,
but he was drawn back insensible. The hatch was
again closed, and holes were cut in the deck to pass
the water down; but the seat of the fire could not be
reached. The cutter was lowered, together with the
two lifeboats, for use in case of need. About 7.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
the fire burst through the decks, and in about half an
hour the whole forecastle was enveloped in flames,
which ran up the rigging, licking up the foresail and
fore-top. The mainmast being of iron, the flames
rushed through the tube as through a chimney, until
it became of a white heat. The lady-passengers in the
after part of the ship must have been kept in a state
of total ignorance of the ship's danger, otherwise it is
impossible to account for their having to rush on board
the boats, at the last moment, with only the dresses
they wore. Only a few minutes before they left the
ship, one of the ladies was playing the 'Guards' Waltz
on the cabin piano!</p>

<p>There was no hope of safety but in the boats, which
were hurriedly got into. On deck, everything was
in a state of confusion. Most of the passengers got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
into the cutter, but without a seaman to take charge
of it. When the water-cask was lowered, it was sent
bung downwards, and nearly half the water was lost.
By this time the burning ship was a grand but fearful
sight, and the roar of the flames was frightful to hear.
At length the cutter and the two lifeboats got away,
and as they floated astern the people in them saw the
masts disappear one by one and the hull of the ship a
roaring mass of fire.</p>

<p>In the early grey of the morning the three boats
mustered, and two of the passengers, who were on
one of the lifeboats, were taken on board the cutter.
It now contained 37 persons, including the captain,
first officer, doctor, steward, purser, several able-bodied
seamen, and all the passengers; while the
two lifeboats had 31 of the crew. The boats drifted
about all day, there being no wind, and the burning
ship was still in sight. On the third day the lifeboats
were not to be seen; each had a box of gold on board,
by way of ballast.</p>

<p>A light breeze having sprung up, sail was made on
the cutter, the captain intending to run for the Falkland
Islands. The sufferings of the passengers increased
from day to day; they soon ran short of water,
until the day's allowance was reduced to about two
tablespoonfuls for each person. It was pitiful to hear
the little children calling for more, but it could not be
given them: men, women, and children had to share
alike. Provisions failed. The biscuit had been spoiled
by the salt water; all that remained in the way of food,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was preserved meat, which was soon exhausted, after
which the only allowance, besides the two tablespoonfuls
of water, was a tablespoonful of preserved soup every
twenty-four hours. Meanwhile the wind freshened, the
sea rose, and the waves came dashing over the passengers,
completely drenching them. The poor ladies,
thinly clad, looked the pictures of misery.</p>

<p>Thus seven days passed&mdash;days of slow agony, such
as words cannot describe&mdash;until at last the joyous
words, "A sail! a sail," roused the sufferers to new
life. A man was sent to the masthead with a red
blanket to hoist by way of signal of distress. The ship
saw the signal and bore down upon the cutter. She
proved to be the 'Pyrmont,' the ship lying within sight
of us, and between which and the 'Yorkshire' our boat
kept plying for the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the rescued people suffered more
after they had got on board the 'Pyrmont' than they
had done during their period of starvation and exposure.
Few of them could stand or walk when taken
on board, all being reduced to the last stage of weakness.
Scarcely had they reached the 'Pyrmont' ere
the third steward died; next day the ship's purser
died insane; and two days after, one of the second-cabin
passengers died. The others, who recovered,
broke out in sores and boils, more particularly on their
hands and feet; and when the 'Yorkshire' met them,
many of the passengers as well as the crew of the burnt
'Blue Jacket' were in a most pitiable plight.</p>

<p>I put off with the third boat which left our ship's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
side for the 'Pyrmont.' We were lying nearly becalmed
all this time, so that passing between the ships
by boat was comparatively easy. We took with us as
much fresh water as we could spare, together with
provisions and other stores. I carried with me a few
spare books for the use of the 'Blue Jacket' passengers.</p>

<p>On reaching the deck of the 'Pyrmont,' the scene
which presented itself was such as I think I shall never
forget. The three rescued ladies were on the poop; and
ladies you could see they were, in spite of their scanty
and dishevelled garments. The dress of one of them
consisted of a common striped man's shirt, a waterproof
cloak made into a skirt, and a pair of coarse canvas
slippers, while on her finger glittered a magnificent
diamond ring. The other ladies were no better dressed,
and none of them had any covering for the head.
Their faces bore distinct traces of the sufferings they
had undergone. Their eyes were sunken, their cheeks
pale, and every now and then a sort of spasmodic
twitch seemed to pass over their features. One of them
could just stand, but could not walk; the others were
comparatively helpless. A gentleman was lying close
by the ladies, still suffering grievously in his hands and
feet from the effects of his long exposure in the open
boat, while one side of his body was completely paralysed.
One poor little boy could not move, and the
doctor said he must lose one or two of his toes through
mortification.</p>

<p>One of the ladies was the wife of the passenger
gentleman who had first come on board of our ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
She was a young lady, newly married, who had just
set out on her wedding trip. What a terrible beginning
of married life! I found she had suffered more
than the others through her devotion to her husband.
He was, at one time, constantly employed in baling the
boat, and would often have given way but for her. She
insisted on his taking half her allowance of water, so
that he had three tablespoonfuls daily instead of two;
whereas she had only one!</p>

<p>While in the boat the women and children were
forced to sit huddled up at one end of it, covered
with a blanket, the seas constantly breaking over
them and soaking through everything. They had
to sit upright, and in very cramped postures, for
fear of capsizing the boat; and the little sleep they
got could only be snatched sitting. Yet they bore
their privations with great courage and patience, and
while the men were complaining and swearing, the
women and children never uttered a complaint.</p>

<p>I had a long talk with the ladies, whom I found
very resigned and most grateful for their deliverance.
I presented my books, which were thankfully received,
and the newly-married lady, forgetful of her miseries,
talked pleasantly and intelligently about current topics,
and home news. It did seem strange for me to be
sitting on the deck of the 'Pyrmont,' in the middle
of the Atlantic, talking with these shipwrecked ladies
about the last new novel!</p>

<p>At last we took our leave, laden with thanks, and
returned on board our ship. It was now growing dusk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
We had done all that we could for the help of the
poor sufferers on board the 'Pyrmont,' and, a light
breeze springing up, all sail was set, and we resumed
our voyage south.</p>

<p>Two of the gold-diggers, who had been second-class
passengers by the 'Blue Jacket,' came on board our
ship with the object of returning with us to Melbourne,
and it is from their recital that I have collated the
above account of the disaster.</p>

<p><i>11th April</i>.&mdash;We are now past the pleasantest part of
our voyage, and expect to encounter much rougher
seas. Everything is accordingly prepared for heavy
weather. The best and newest sails are bent; the old
and worn ones are sent below. We may have to encounter
storms or even cyclones in the Southern Ocean,
and our captain is now ready for any wind that may
blow. For some days we have had a very heavy swell
coming up from the south, as if there were strong
winds blowing in that quarter. We have, indeed,
already had a taste of dirty weather to-day&mdash;hard
rain, with a stiffish breeze; but as the ship is still
going with the wind and sea, we do not as yet feel
much inconvenience.</p>

<p>A few days since, we spoke a vessel that we had been
gradually coming up to for some time, and she proved to
be the 'George Thompson,' a splendid Aberdeen-built
clipper, one of the fastest ships out of London. No sooner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was this known, than it became a matter of great interest
as to whether we could overhaul the clipper. Our ship,
because of the height and strength of her spars, enables
us to carry much more sail, and we are probably equal
to the other ship in lighter breezes; but she, being
clipper-built and so much sharper, has the advantage
of us in heavier winds. The captain was overjoyed
at having gained upon the other vessel thus far, for
she left London five days before we sailed from Plymouth.
As we gradually drew nearer, the breeze
freshened, and there became quite an exciting contest
between the ships. We gained upon our rival, caught
up to her, and gradually forged ahead, and at sundown
the 'George Thompson' was about six miles astern.
Before we caught up to her she signalled to us, by way
of chaff, "Signal us at Lloyd's!" and when we had
passed her, we signalled back, "We wish you a good
voyage!"</p>

<p>The wind having freshened during the night, the
'George Thompson' was seen gradually creeping up to
us with all her sail set. The wind was on our beam,
and the 'George Thompson's' dark green hull seemed
to us sometimes almost buried in the sea, and we only
saw her slanting deck as she heeled over from the
freshening breeze. What a cloud of canvas she carried!
The spray flew up and over her decks, as she plunged
right through the water.</p>

<p>The day advanced; she continued to gain, and towards
evening she passed on our weather-side. The
captain, of course, was savage; but the race was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
lost yet. On the following day, with a lighter wind,
we again overhauled our rival, and at night left her
four or five miles behind. Next day she was not to
be seen. We had thus far completely outstripped the
noted clipper.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>We again begin to reconsider the question of giving
a popular entertainment on board. The ordinary recreations
of quoit-playing, and such like, have become
unpopular, and a little variety is wanted. A reading
from 'Pickwick' is suggested; but cannot we contrive
to <i>act</i> a few of the scenes! We determine to get up
three of the most attractive:&mdash;1st. The surprise of
Mrs. Bardell in Pickwick's arms; 2nd. The notice of
action from Dodson and Fogg; and 3rd. The Trial
scene. A great deal of time is, of course, occupied
in getting up the scenes, and in the rehearsals, which
occasion a good deal of amusement. A London gentleman
promises to make a capital Sam Weller; our
clergyman a very good Buzfuz; and our worthy young
doctor the great Pickwick himself.</p>

<p>At length all is ready, and the affair comes off in
the main-hatch, where there is plenty of room. The
theatre is rigged out with flags, and looks quite gay.
The passengers of all classes assemble, and make a
goodly company. The whole thing went off very well&mdash;indeed,
much better than was expected&mdash;though I
do not think the third-class passengers quite appreciated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the wit of the piece. Strange to say, the greatest
success of the evening was the one least expected&mdash;the
character of Mrs. Cluppins. One of the middies
who took the part, was splendid, and evoked roars of
laughter.</p>

<p>Our success has made us ambitious, and we think of
getting up another piece&mdash;a burlesque, entitled 'Sir
Dagobert and the Dragon,' from one of my Beeton's
'Annuals.' There is not much in it; but, <i>faute de
mieux</i>, it may do very well. But to revert to less
"towny" and much more interesting matters passing
on board.</p>

<p>We were in about the latitude of the Cape of Good
Hope when we saw our first albatross; but as we proceeded
south, we were attended by increasing numbers
of those birds as well as of Mother Carey's chickens,
the storm-birds of the South Seas. The albatross is a
splendid bird, white on the breast and the inside of
the wings, the rest of the body being deep brown and
black.</p>

<p>One of the most popular amusements is "fishing"
for an albatross, which is done in the following manner.
A long and stout line is let out, with a strong hook
at the end baited with a piece of meat, buoyed up
with corks. This is allowed to trail on the water at
the stern of the ship. One or other of the sea-birds
wheeling about, seeing the floating object in the water,
comes up, eyes it askance, and perhaps at length clumsily
flops down beside it. The line is at once let out, so
that the bait may not drag after the ship. If this be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
done cleverly, and there be length enough of line to
let out quickly, the bird probably makes a snatch at
the meat, and the hook catches hold of his curved bill.
Directly he grabs at the pork, and it is felt that the
albatross is hooked, the letting out of the line is at once
stopped, and it is hauled in with all speed. The great
thing is to pull quickly, so as to prevent the bird getting
the opportunity of spreading his wings, and making a
heavy struggle as he comes along on the surface of the
water. It is a good heavy pull for two men to get up
an albatross if the ship is going at any speed. The poor
fellow, when hauled on deck, is no longer the royal
bird that he seemed when circling above our heads
with his great wings spread out only a few minutes
ago. Here he is quite helpless, and tries to waddle
about like a great goose; the first thing he often does
being to void all the contents of his stomach, as if he
were seasick.</p>

<p>The first albatross we caught was not a very large
one, being only about ten feet from tip to tip of the
wings; whereas the larger birds measure from twelve
to thirteen feet. The bird, when caught, was held
firmly down, and despatched by the doctor with the
aid of prussic acid. He was then cut up, and his skin,
for the sake of the feathers and plumage, divided
amongst us. The head and neck fell to my share, and,
after cleaning and dressing it, I hung my treasure by
a string out of my cabin-window; but, when I next
went to look at it, lo! the string had been cut, and
my albatross's head and neck were gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>All day the saloon and various cabins smelt very
fishy by reason of the operations connected with the
dissecting and cleaning of the several parts of the albatross.
One was making a pipe-stem out of one of the
long wing-bones. Another was making a tobacco
pouch out of the large feet of the bird. The doctor's
cabin was like a butcher's shop in these bird-catching
times. Part of his floor would be occupied by the
bloody skin of the great bird, stretched out upon
boards, with the doctor on his knees beside it working
away with his dissecting scissors and pincers, getting
the large pieces of fat off the skin. Esculapius seemed
quite to relish the operation; whilst, on the other hand
the clergyman, who occupied the same cabin, held his
handkerchief to his nose, and regarded the d&eacute;bris
of flesh and feathers on the floor with horror and
dismay.</p>

<p>Other birds, of a kind we had not before seen
shortly made their appearance, flying round the ship.
There is, for instance, the whale-bird, perfectly black
on the top of the wings and body, and white underneath.
It is, in size, between a Mother Carey and a
Molly-hawk, which latter is very nearly as big as an
albatross. Ice-birds and Cape-pigeons also fly about us
in numbers; the latter are about the size of ordinary
pigeons, black, mottled with white on the back, and
grey on the breast.</p>

<p>A still more interesting sight was that of a great
grampus, which rose close to the ship, exposing his
body as he leapt through a wave. Shortly after, a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
more were seen at a greater distance, as if playing
about and gambolling for our amusement.</p>

<p><i>17th April</i>.&mdash;The weather is growing sensibly colder.
Instead of broiling under cover, in the thinnest of
garments, we now revert to our winter clothing for
comfort. Towards night the wind rose, and gradually
increased until it blew a heavy gale, so strong that all
the sails had to be taken in&mdash;all but the foresail and
the main-topsail closely reefed. Luckily for us, the
wind was nearly aft, so that we did not feel its effects
nearly so much as if it had been on our beam. Tonight
we rounded the Cape, twenty-four days from the
Line and forty-five from Plymouth.</p>

<p>On the following day the wind was still blowing
hard. When I went on deck in the morning, I found
that the mainsail had been split up the middle, and
carried away with a loud bang to sea. The ship was
now under mizen-topsail, close-reefed main-topsail, and
fore-topsail and foresail, no new mainsail having been
bent. The sea was a splendid sight. Waves, like
low mountains, came rolling after us, breaking along
each side of the ship. I was a personal sufferer by the
gale. I had scarcely got on deck when the wind whisked
off my Scotch cap with the silver thistle in it, and blew
it away to sea. Then, in going down to my cabin, I
found my books, boxes, and furniture lurching about;
and, to wind up with, during the evening I was rolled
over while sitting on one of the cuddy chairs, and
broke it. Truly a day full of small misfortunes for
me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In the night I was awakened by the noise and the
violent rolling of the ship. The mizen-mast strained
and creaked; chairs had broken loose in the saloon;
crockery was knocking about and smashing up in the
steward's pantry. In the cabin adjoining, the water-can
and bath were rambling up and down; and in the midst
of all the hubbub the Major could be heard shouting,
"Two to one on the water-can!" "They were just
taking the fences," he said. There were few but had
some mishap in their cabins. One had a hunt after a
box that had broken loose; another was lamenting the
necessity of getting up after his washhand-basin and
placing his legs in peril outside his bunk. Before
breakfast I went on deck to look at the scene. It was
still blowing a gale. We were under topsails and
mainsail, with a close-reefed top-sail on the mizen-mast.
The sight from the poop is splendid. At one moment
we were high up on the top of a wave, looking into a
deep valley behind us; at another we were down in the
trough of the sea, with an enormous wall of water
coming after us. The pure light-green waves were
crested with foam, which curled over and over, and
never stopped rolling. The deck lay over at a dreadful
slant to a landsman's eye; indeed, notwithstanding
holding on to everything I could catch, I fell four times
during the morning.</p>

<p>With difficulty I reached the saloon, where the passengers
had assembled for breakfast. Scarcely had we
taken out seats when an enormous sea struck the ship,
landed on the poop, dashed in the saloon skylight, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
flooded the table with water. This was a bad event
for those who had not had their breakfast. As I was
mounting the cuddy stairs, I met the captain coming
down thoroughly soaked. He had been knocked down,
and had to hold on by a chain to prevent himself
being washed about the deck. The officer of the watch
afterwards told me that he had seen his head bobbing
up and down amidst the water, of which there were
tons on the poop.</p>

<p>This was what they call "shipping a green sea,"&mdash;so
called because so much water is thrown upon the deck
that it ceases to have the frothy appearance of smaller
seas when shipped, but looks a mass of solid green
water. Our skipper afterwards told us at dinner that
the captain of the 'Essex' had not long ago been
thrown by such a sea on to one of the hen-coops that
run round the poop, breaking through the iron bars,
and that he had been so bruised that he had not yet
entirely recovered from his injuries. Such is the
tremendous force of water in violent motion at sea.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>When I went on deck again, the wind had somewhat
abated, but the sea was still very heavy. While on
the poop, one enormous wave came rolling on after us,
seeming as if it must engulf the ship. But the stern
rose gradually and gracefully as the huge wave came
on, and it rolled along, bubbling over the sides of the
main-deck, and leaving it about two feet deep in water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
As the day wore on the wind gradually went down,
and it seemed as if
we were to have
another spell of fine
weather.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Next morning
the sun shone
clear; the wind
had nearly died
away, though a
heavy swell still
crossed our quarter.
Thousands of sea-birds
flew about
us, and clusters
were to be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
off our stern, as far as the eye could reach. They
seemed, though on a much larger scale, to be hanging
upon our track, just as a flock of crows hang
over the track of a plough in the field, and doubtless
for the same reason&mdash;to pick up the food thrown
up by the mighty keel of our ship. Most of them
were ice-birds, blue petrels, and whale-birds, with
a large admixture of albatrosses and Mother Carey's
chickens. One of the passengers caught and killed
one of the last-named birds, at which the captain was
rather displeased, the sailors having a superstition
about these birds, that it is unlucky to kill them. An
ice-bird was caught, and a very pretty bird it is, almost
pure white, with delicate blue feet and beak. Another
caught a Cape pigeon, and I caught a stink-pot, a
large bird measuring about eight feet from wing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
wing. The bird was very plucky when got on deck,
and tried to peck at us; but we soon had him down.
As his plumage was of no use, we fastened a small
tin-plate to his leg, with 'Yorkshire' scratched on it,
and let him go. But it was some time before he rose
from his waddling on the deck, spread his wings, and
sailed into the air.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers carry on shooting at the
numerous birds from the stern of the ship; but it is
cruel sport. It may be fun to us, but it is death to the
birds. And not always death. Poor things! It is a
pitiful sight to see one of them, pricked or winged,
floating away with its wounds upon it, until quite
out of sight. Such sport seems cruel, if it be not
cowardly.</p>

<p><i>23rd April</i>.&mdash;We are now in latitude 45.16&deg; south,
and the captain tells us that during the night we may
probably sight the Crozet Islands. It seems that these
islands are inaccurately marked on the charts, some of
even the best authorities putting them from one and a
half to two degrees out both in latitude and longitude,
as the captain showed us by a late edition of a standard
work on navigation. Once he came pretty well south
on purpose to sight them; but when he reached the
precise latitude in which, according to his authority,
they were situated, they were not to be seen.</p>

<p>At 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the man on the look-out gave the cry
of "Land ho!" "Where away?" "On the lee beam."
I strained my eyes in the direction indicated, but could
make out nothing like land. I could see absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
nothing but water all round. Two hours passed before
I could discern anything which could give one the idea
of land&mdash;three small, misty, cloud-looking objects,
lying far off to the south, which were said to be the
islands. In about an hour more we were within about
five miles of Les Ap&ocirc;tres, part of the group, having
passed Cochon in the distance. Cochon is so called
because of the number of wild pigs on the island. The
largest, Possession Island, gave refuge to the shipwrecked
crew of a whaler for about two years, when
they were at length picked off by a passing ship. The
Crozets are of volcanic origin, and some of them present
a curious, conical, and sometimes fantastic appearance,
more particularly Les Ap&ocirc;tres. The greater number of
them are quite barren, the only vegetation of the others
consisting of a few low stunted bushes.</p>

<p>More theatricals! 'Sir Dagobert and the Dragon' is
played, and comes off very well. The extemporised
dresses and "properties" are the most amusing of all.
The company next proceed to get up 'Aladdin and the
Wonderful Scamp' to pass the time, which hangs heavy
on our hands. We now begin to long for the termination
of our voyage. We have sailed about 10,000 miles,
but have still about 3000 more before us.</p>

<p><i>30th April</i>.&mdash;To-day we have made the longest run
since we left Plymouth, not less than 290 miles in
twenty-four hours. We have before made 270, but
then the sea was smooth, and the wind fair. Now the
wind is blowing hard on our beam, with a heavy sea
running. About 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we sighted a barque steering
at right angles to our course. In a short time we came
up with her, and found that she was the Dutch barque
'Vrede,' ninety-eight days from Amsterdam and bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
for Batavia. She crossed so close to our stern that one
might almost have pitched a biscuit on board.</p>

<p>During the night the sea rose, the wind blowing
strong across our beam, and the ship pitched and rolled
as she is said never to have done since she was built.
There was not much sleep for us that night. The wind
increased to a strong gale, until at length it blew quite
a hurricane. It was scarcely possible to stand on deck.
The wind felt as if it blew solid. The ship was driving
furiously along under close-reefed topsails. Looking
over the side, one could only see the black waves,
crested with foam, scudding past.</p>

<p>It appears that we are now in a cyclone&mdash;not in the
worst part of it, but in the inner edge of the outside
circle. Skilful navigators know by experience how to
make their way out of these furious ocean winds, and
our captain was equal to the emergency. In about
seven hours we were quite clear of it, though the wind
blew fresh, and the ship rolled heavily, the sea continuing
for some time in a state of great agitation.</p>

<p>For some days the wind keeps favourable, and our
ship springs forward as if she knew her port, and was
eager to reach it. A few more days and we may be
in sight of Australia. We begin almost to count the
hours. In anticipation of our arrival, the usual testimonial
to the captain is set on foot, all being alike
ready to bear testimony to his courtesy and seamanship.
On deck, the men began to holystone the planks,
polish up the brasswork, and make everything shipshape
for port. The middies are at work here on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
poop, each "with a sharp knife and a clear conscience,"
cutting away pieces of tarry rope. New ratlines are
being fastened up across the shrouds. The standing
rigging is re-tarred and shines black. The deck is
fresh scraped as well as the mizen-mast, and the white
paint-pot has been used freely.</p>

<p><i>9th May.</i>&mdash;We are now in Australian waters, sailing
along under the lee of Cape Leeuwin, though the land
is not yet in sight. Australian birds are flying about
our ship, unlike any we have yet seen. We beat up
against the wind which is blowing off the land, our
yards slewed right round. It is provoking to be so
near the end of our voyage, and blown back when
almost in sight of port.</p>

<p><i>14th May.</i>&mdash;After four days of contrary wind, it
changed again, and we are now right for Melbourne.
Our last theatrical performance came off with great
<i>&eacute;clat</i>. The captain gave his parting supper after the
performance; and the <i>menu</i> was remarkable, considering
that we had been out eighty-one days from Gravesend.
There were ducks, fowls, tongues, hams, with
lobster-salads, oyster patt&eacute;s, jellies, blanc-manges, and
dessert. Surely the art of preserving fresh meat and
comestibles must have nearly reached perfection. To
wind up, songs were sung, toasts proposed, and the
captain's testimonial was presented amidst great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><i>18th May.</i>&mdash;We sighted the Australian land to-day
about thirteen miles off Cape Otway. The excitement
on board was very great; and no wonder, after so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a voyage. Some were going home there, to rejoin
their families, relatives, and friends. Others were going
there for pleasure or for health. Perhaps the greater
number regarded it as the land of their choice&mdash;a sort
of promised land&mdash;where they were to make for themselves
a home, and hoped to carve out for themselves
a road to competency if not to fortune.</p>

<p>We gradually neared the land, until we were only
about five miles distant from it. The clouds lay low on
the sandy shore; the dark-green scrub here and there
reaching down almost to the water's edge. The coast
is finely undulating, hilly in some places, and well
wooded. Again we beat off the land, to round Cape
Otway, whose light we see. Early next morning
we signal the lighthouse, and the news of our approaching
arrival will be forthwith telegraphed to
Melbourne. The wind, however, dies away when we
are only about thirty miles from Port Phillip Heads,
and there we lie idly becalmed the whole afternoon, the
ship gently rolling in the light-blue water, the sails
flapping against the masts, or occasionally drawing half
full, with a fitful puff of wind. Our only occupation
was to watch the shore, and with the help of the telescope
we could make out little wooden huts half hidden
in the trees, amidst patches of cultivated land. As the
red sun set over the dark-green hills, there sprang up
the welcome evening breeze, which again filled our
canvas, and the wavelets licked the ship's sides as she
yielded to the wind, and at last sped us on to Port
Phillip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>At midnight we are in sight of the light at the
entrance of the bay. Then we are taken in tow by a
tug, up to the Heads, where we wait until sunrise for
our pilot to come on board. The Heads are low necks
of sandy hillocks, one within another, that guard the
entrance to the extensive bay of Port Phillip. On one
side is Point Lonsdale, and on the other Point Nepean.</p>

<p><i>21st May.</i>&mdash;Our pilot comes on board early, and takes
our ship in charge. He is a curious-looking object,
more like a Jew bailiff than anything else I can think
of, and very unlike an English "salt." But the man
seems to know his work, and away we go, tugged by
our steamer.</p>

<p>A little inside the Heads, we are boarded by the
quarantine officer, who inquires as to the health of
the ship, which is satisfactory, and we proceed up the
bay. Shortly after, we pass, on the west, Queenscliffe,
a pretty village built on a bit of abrupt headland, the
houses of which dot the green sward. The village
church is a pleasant object in the landscape. We
curiously spy the land as we pass. By the help of the
telescope we can see signs of life on shore. We observe,
amongst other things, an early tradesman's cart, drawn
by a fast-trotting pony, driving along the road. More
dwellings appear, amidst a pretty, well cultivated,
rolling landscape.</p>

<p>At length we lose sight of the shore, proceeding up
the bay towards Melbourne, which is nearly some 30
miles distant, and still below the horizon. Sailing on,
the tops of trees rise up; then low banks of sand, flat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
tracts of bush, and, slightly elevated above them, occasional
tracts of clear yellow space. Gradually rising
up in the west, distant hills come in sight; and,
towards the north, an undulating region is described,
stretching round the bay inland.</p>

<p>We now near the northern shore, and begin to perceive
houses, and ships, and spires. The port of Williamstown
comes in sight, full of shipping, as appears
by the crowd of masts. Outside of it is Her Majesty's
ship 'Nelson,' lying at anchor. On the right is the
village or suburb of St. Kilda, and still further round
is Brighton. Sandridge, the landing-place of Melbourne,
lies right ahead of us, and over the masts of
shipping we are pointed to a mass of houses in the
distance, tipped with spires and towers, and are told,
"There is the city of Melbourne!"</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we were alongside the large wooden railway-pier
of Sandridge, and soon many of our fellow-passengers
were in the arms of their friends and
relatives. Others, of whom I was one, had none to
welcome us; but, like the rest, I took my ticket for
Melbourne, only some three miles distant; and in the
course of another quarter of an hour I found myself
safely landed in the great city of the Antipodes.</p>

Ladies</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Visit to a Serious Family</span>.</p>


<p>I arrive in Melbourne towards evening, and on stepping
out of the railway-train find myself amidst a
glare of gas lamps. Outside the station the streets are
all lit up, the shops are brilliant with light, and well-dressed
people are moving briskly about.</p>

<p>What is this large building in Bourke Street, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the crowd standing about? It is the Royal Theatre.
A large stone-faced hall inside the portico, surrounded
by bars brilliantly lit, is filled with young men in
groups lounging about, talking and laughing. At the
further end of the vestibule are the entrances to the
different parts of the house.</p>

<p>Further up the same street, I come upon a large
market-place, in a blaze of light, where crowds of people
are moving about, buying vegetables, fruit, meat, and
such like. At the further end of the street the din
and bustle are less, and I see a large structure standing
in an open space, looking black against the starlit sky.
I afterwards find that it is the Parliament House.</p>

<p>Such is my first introduction to Melbourne. It is
evidently a place stirring with life. After strolling
through some of the larger streets, and everywhere
observing the same indications of wealth, and traffic,
and population, I took the train for Sandridge, and
slept a good sound sleep in my bunk on board the
'Yorkshire' for the last time.</p>

<p>Next morning I returned to Melbourne in the
broad daylight, when I was able to make a more deliberate
survey of the city. I was struck by the width
and regularity of some of the larger streets, and by
the admirable manner in which they are paved and
kept. The whole town seems to have been laid out
on a systematic plan, which some might think even too
regular and uniform. But the undulating nature of
the ground on which the city is built serves to correct
this defect, if defect it be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The streets are mostly laid out at right angles; broad
streets one way, and alternate broad and narrow streets
crossing them. Collins and Bourke Streets are, perhaps,
the finest. The view from the high ground, at one end
of Collins Street, looking down the hollow of the road,
and right away up the hill on the other side, is very
striking. This grand street, of great width, is probably
not less than a mile long. On either side are
the principal bank buildings, tall and handsome. Just a
little way up the hill, on the further side, is a magnificent
white palace-like structure, with a richly ornamented
fa&ccedil;ade and tower. That is the New Town Hall. Higher
up is a fine church spire, and beyond it a red brick
tower, pricked out with yellow, standing in bold relief
against the clear blue sky. You can just see Bourke
and Wills' monument there, in the centre of the roadway.
And at the very end of the perspective, the
handsome grey front of the Treasury bounds the view.</p>

<p>Amongst the peculiarities of the Melbourne streets
are the deep, broad stone gutters, on either side of the
roadway, evidently intended for the passage of a very
large quantity of water in the rainy season. They are
so broad as to render it necessary to throw little wooden
bridges over them at the street-crossings. I was told
that these open gutters are considered by no means
promotive of the health of the inhabitants, which one
can readily believe; and it is probable that before
long they will be covered up.</p>

<p>Walk over Collins and Bourke Street at nine or
ten in the morning, and you meet the business men of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Melbourne on their way from the railway-station to
their offices in town: for the greater number of them,
as in London, live in the suburbs. The shops are all
open, everything looking bright and clean. Pass along
the same streets in the afternoon, and you will find
gaily-dressed ladies flocking the pathways. The shops
are bustling with customers. There are many private
carriages to be seen, with two-wheeled cars, on which
the passengers sit back to back, these (with the
omnibuses) being the public conveyances of Melbourne.
Collins Street may be regarded as the favourite promenade;
more particularly between three and four in
the afternoon, when shopping is merely the excuse of
its numerous fashionable frequenters.</p>

<p>One thing struck me especially&mdash;the very few old
or grey-haired people one meets with in the streets of
Melbourne. They are mostly young people; and there
are comparatively few who have got beyond the middle
stage of life. And no wonder. For how young a city
Melbourne is! Forty years since there was not a house
in the place.</p>

<p>Where the Melbourne University now stands, a few
miserable Australian blacks would meet and hold a
corroboree; but, except it might be a refugee bush-ranger
from Sydney, there was not a white man in all
Victoria. The first settler, John Batman,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> arrived in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the harbour of Port Phillip as recently as the year
1835, since which time the colony has been planted,
the city of Melbourne has been built, and Victoria
covered with farms, mines, towns, and people. When Sir
Thomas Mitchell first visited the colony in 1836, though
comprehending an area of more than a hundred thousand
square miles, it did not contain 200 white people.
In 1845 the population had grown to 32,000; Melbourne
had been founded, and was beginning to grow rapidly;
now it contains a population of about 200,000 souls,
and is already the greatest city in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that the population of Melbourne
should be young. It consists for the most part
of immigrants from Great Britain and other countries,&mdash;of
men and women in the prime of life,&mdash;pushing,
enterprising, energetic people. Nor is the stream of
immigration likely to stop soon. The land in the
interior is not one-tenth part occupied; and "the cry
is, still they come." Indeed many think the immigrants
do not come quickly enough. Every ship
brings a fresh batch; and the "new chums" may be
readily known, as they assemble in knots at the corners
of the streets, by their ruddy colour, their gaping
curiosity, and their home looks.</p>

<p>Another thing that strikes me in Melbourne is this,&mdash;that
I have not seen a beggar in the place. There
is work for everybody who will work; so there is no
excuse for begging. A great many young fellows who
come out here no doubt do not meet with the fortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
they think they deserve. They expected that a few
good letters of introduction were all that was necessary
to enable them to succeed. But they are soon undeceived.
They must strip to work, if they would do
any good. Mere clerks, who can write and add up
figures, are of no use; the colony is over-stocked with
them. But if they are handy, ready to work, and
willing to turn their hand to anything, they need never
be without the means of honest living.</p>

<p>In many respects Melbourne is very like home. It
looks like a slice of England transplanted here, only
everything looks fresher and newer. Go into Fitzroy
or Carlton Gardens in the morning, and you will see
almost the self-same nurses and children that you
saw in the Parks in London. At dusk you see the
same sort of courting couples mooning about, not
knowing what next to say. In the streets you see
a corps of rifle volunteers marching along, just as at
home, on Saturday afternoons. Down at Sandridge
you see the cheap-trip steamer, decked with flags,
taking a boat-load of excursionists down the bay to
some Australian Margate or Ramsgate. On the wooden
pier the same steam-cranes are at work, loading and
unloading trucks.</p>

<p>One thing, however, there is at Melbourne that you
cannot see in any town in England, and that is the
Chinese quarter. There the streets are narrower and
dirtier than anywhere else, and you see the yellow-faced
folks stand jabbering at their doors&mdash;a very
novel sight. The Chinamen, notwithstanding the poll-tax<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
originally imposed on them of 10<i>l.</i> a head, have
come into Victoria in large and increasing numbers,
and before long they threaten to become a great power
in the colony. They are a very hardworking, but, it
must be confessed, a very low class, dirty people.</p>

<p>Though many of the Chinamen give up their native
dress and adopt the European costume, more particularly
the billycock hat, there is one part of their belongings
that they do not part with even in the last extremity&mdash;and
that is their tail. They may hide it away in
their billycock or in the collar of their coat; but,
depend upon it, the tail is there. My friend, the
doctor of the 'Yorkshire,' being a hunter after natural
curiosities, had, amongst other things, a great ambition
to possess himself of a Chinaman's tail. One
day, walking up Collins Street, I met my enthusiastic
friend. He recognised me, and waved something about
frantically that he had in his hand. "I've got it! I've
got it!" he exclaimed, in a highly excited manner.
"What have you got?" I asked, wondering. "Come in
here," said he, "and I'll show it you." We turned
into a bar, when he carefully undid his parcel, and
exposed to view a long black thing. "What <i>is</i> it?"
I asked. "A Chinaman's pigtail, of course," said he,
triumphantly; "and a very rare curiosity it is, I can
assure you."</p>

<p>Among the public institutes of Melbourne one of the
finest is the Public Library, already containing, I was
told, about 80,000 volumes. It is really a Library for
the People, and a noble one too. So far as I can learn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
there is nothing yet in England that can be compared
with it.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Working men come here, and read at their
leisure scientific books, historical books, or whatever
they may desire. They may come in their working
dress, signing their names on entering, the only condition
required of them being quietness and good behaviour.
About five hundred readers use the library daily.</p>

<p>Nor must I forget the Victorian collection of pictures,
in the same building as the Public Library. The
galleries are good, and contain many attractive paintings.
Amongst them I noticed Goodall's 'Rachel at
the Well,' Cope's 'Pilgrim Fathers' (a replica), and
some excellent specimens of Chevalier, a rising colonial
artist.</p>

<p>The Post Office is another splendid building, one of
the most commodious institutions of the kind in the
world. There the arrival of each mail from England
is announced by the hoisting of a large red flag, with
the letter A (arrival).</p>

<p>In evidence of the advanced "civilization" of Melbourne,
let me also describe a visit which I paid to its
gaol. But it is more than a gaol, for it is the great
penal establishment of the colony. The prison at Pentridge
is about eight miles from Melbourne. Accompanied
by a friend, I was driven thither in a covered
car along a very dusty but well-kept road. Alighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
at the castle-like entrance to the principal courtyard,
we passed through a small doorway, behind which was
a strong iron-bar gate, always kept locked, and watched
by a warder. The gate was unlocked, and we shortly
found ourselves in the great prison area, in the
presence of sundry men in grey prison uniform, with
heavy irons on. Passing across the large clean yard,
we make for a gate in the high granite wall at its
further side. A key is let down to us by the warder,
who is keeping armed watch in his sentry-box on the
top of the wall. We use it, let ourselves in, lock
the door, and the key is hauled up again.</p>

<p>We enter the female prison, where we are shown
the cells, each with its small table and neatly-folded
mattress. On the table is a Bible and Prayer-book,
and sometimes a third book for amusement or instruction.
In some of the cells, where the inmates are
learning to read and write, there is a spelling primer
and a copybook for pothooks. The female prisoners
are not in their cells, but we shortly after find them
assembled in a large room above, seated and at work.
They all rose at our entrance, and I had a good look
at their faces. There was not a single decent honest
face amongst them. They were mostly heavy, square-jawed,
hard-looking women. Judging by their faces,
vice and ugliness would seem to be pretty nearly
akin.</p>

<p>We were next taken to the centre of the prison,
from which we looked down upon the narrow, high-walled
yards, in which the prisoners condemned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
solitary confinement take their exercise. These yards
all radiate from a small tower, in which a warder is
stationed, carefully watching the proceedings below.</p>

<p>We shortly saw the prisoners of Department A
coming in from their exercise in the yard. Each wore
a white mask on his face with eyeholes in it; and no
prisoner must approach another nearer than five yards,
at risk of severe punishment. The procession was a
very dismal one. In the half-light of the prison they
marched silently on one by one, with their faces hidden,
each touching his cap as he passed.</p>

<p>Department B came next. The men here do not
work in their separate cells, like the others, but go
out to work in gangs, guarded by armed warders. The
door of each cell throughout the prison has a small
hole in it, through which the warders, who move
about the galleries in list shoes, can peep in, and, unknown
to the prisoner, see what he is about.</p>

<p>Both male and female prisons have Black Holes
attached to them for the solitary confinement of the
refractory. Dreadful places they look: small cells
about ten feet by four, into which not a particle of
light is admitted. Three thick doors, one within
another, render it impossible for the prisoner inside
to make himself heard without.</p>

<p>Next comes Department C, in which the men finish
their time. Here many sleep in one room, always
under strict watch, being employed during the day at
their respective trades, or going out in gangs to work
in the fields connected with the establishment. Connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with this department is a considerable factory,
with spinning-machines, weaving-frames, and dye vats;
the whole of the clothes and blankets used in the gaol
being made by the prisoners, as well as the blankets
supplied by the Government to the natives. Adjoining
are blacksmiths' shops, where manacles are forged;
shoemakers' shops; tailors' shops; a bookbinder's shop,
where the gaol books are bound; and shops for various
other crafts.</p>

<p>The prison library is very well furnished with books.
Dickens's and Trollope's works are there, and I saw
a well-read copy of 'Self-Help,' though it was doubtless
through a very different sort of self-help that
most of the prisoners who perused it had got there.</p>

<p>Last of all, we saw the men searched on coming in
from their work in the fields, or in the different workshops.
They all stood in a line while the warder passed
his hands down their bodies and legs, and looked into
their hats. Then he turned to a basin of water standing
by, and carefully washed his hands.</p>

<p>There were about 700 prisoners of both sexes in the
gaol when we visited it. I was told that the walls of
the prison enclose an area of 132 acres, so that there
is abundance of space for all kinds of work. On the
whole it was a very interesting, but at the same time
a sad sight.</p>

<p>I think very little of the River Yarra Yarra, on
which Melbourne is situated. It is a muddy, grey-coloured
stream, very unpicturesque. It has, however,
one great advantage over most other Australian rivers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
as indicated by its name, which in the native language
means the "ever-flowing;" many of the creeks and
rivers in Australia being dry in summer. I hired a
boat for the purpose of a row up the Yarra. A little
above the city its banks are pretty and ornamental,
especially where it passes the Botanic Gardens, which
are beautifully laid out, and well stocked with India-rubber
plants, gum-trees, and magnificent specimens of
the Southern fauna. Higher up, the river&mdash;though its
banks continue green&mdash;becomes more monotonous, and
we soon dropped back to Melbourne with the stream.</p>

<p>It is the seaside of Melbourne that is by far the
most interesting,&mdash;Williamstown, with its shipping;
but more especially the pretty suburbs, rapidly growing
into towns, along the shores of the Bay of Port Phillip&mdash;such
as St. Kilda, Elsternwick, Brighton, and Cheltenham.
You see how they preserve the old country
names. St. Kilda is the nearest to Melbourne, being
only about three miles distant by rail, and it is the
favourite resort of the Melbourne people. Indeed,
many of the first-class business men reside there, just
as Londoners do at Blackheath and Forest Hill. The
esplanade along the beach is a fine promenade, and the
bathing along shore is exceedingly good. There are
large enclosures for bathers, surrounded by wooden
piles; above the enclosure, raised high on platforms,
are commodious dressing-rooms, where, instead of being
cooped up in an uncomfortable bathing-machine, you
may have a lounge outside in the bright sunshine while
you dress. The water is a clear blue, and there is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
sandy bottom sloping down from the shore into any
depth,&mdash;a glorious opportunity for swimmers!</p>

<p>I must now tell you something of my social experiences
in Melbourne. Thanks to friends at home, I had
been plentifully supplied with letters of introduction to
people in the colony. When I spoke of these to old
colonials in the 'Yorkshire,' I was told that they were
"no good"&mdash;no better than so many "tickets for soup,"
if worth even that. I was, therefore, quite prepared
for a cool reception; but, nevertheless, took the opportunity
of delivering my letters shortly after landing.</p>

<p>So far from being received with coldness, I was
received with the greatest kindness wherever I went.
People who had never seen me before, and who knew
nothing of me or my family, gave me a welcome that
was genuine, frank, and hearty in the extreme. My
letters, I found, were far more than "tickets for soup."
They introduced me to pleasant companions and kind
friends, who entertained me hospitably, enabled me to
pass my time pleasantly, and gave me much practical
good advice. Indeed, so far as my experience goes,
the hospitality of Victoria ought to become proverbial.</p>

<p>One of the first visits I made was to a recent school-fellow
of mine at Geneva. I found him at work in a
bank, and astonished him very much by the suddenness
of my appearance. He was most kind to me
during my stay in Melbourne, as well as all his family,
to whom I owed a succession of kindnesses which I can
never forget.</p>

<p>I shall always retain a pleasant recollection of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
marriage festivity to which I was invited within a week
after my arrival. A ball was given in the evening, at
which about 300 persons were present&mdash;the <i>elite</i> of
Melbourne society. It was held in a large marquee,
with a splendid floor, and ample space for dancing.
Everything was ordered very much the same as at
home. The dresses of the ladies seemed more costly,
the music was probably not so good, though very fair,
and the supper rather better. I fancy there was no
"contract champagne" at that ball.</p>

<p>One thing I must remark about the ladies&mdash;they
seemed to me somehow a little different in appearance.
Indeed, when I first landed, I fancied I saw a slightly
worn look, a want of freshness, in the people generally.
They told me there that it is the effect of the dry Australian
climate and the long summer heat, native-born
Australians having a tendency to grow thin and lathy.
Not that there was any want of beauty about the
Melbourne girls, or that they were not up to the mark
in personal appearance. On the contrary, there was
quite a bevy of belles, some of them extremely pretty
girls, most tastefully dressed, and I thought the twelve
bridesmaids, in white silk trimmed with blue, looked
charming.</p>

<p>I spent a very pleasant evening with this gay company,
and had my fill of dancing after my long privation
at sea. When I began to step out, the room seemed
to be in motion. I had got so accustomed to the roll
of the ship that I still felt unsteady, and when I put
my foot down it went further than I expected before it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
touched the floor. But I soon got quit of my sea legs,
which I had so much difficulty in finding.</p>

<p>Before concluding my few Melbourne experiences, I
will mention another of a very different character from
the above. I was invited to spend the following
Saturday and Sunday with a gentleman and his family.
I was punctual to my appointment, and was driven by
my carman up to the door of a new house in a very
pretty situation. I was shown into the drawing-room,
where I waited some time for the mistress of the
house to make her appearance. She was a matronly
person, with a bland smile on her countenance. Her
dress was of a uniform grey, with trimmings of the
same colour. We tried conversation, but somehow it
failed. I fear my remarks were more meaningless
than usual on such occasions. Certainly the lady and
I did not hit it at all. She asked me if I had heard
such and such a Scotch minister, or had read somebody's
sermons which she named? Alas! I had not
so much as heard of their names. Judging by her
looks, she must have thought me an ignoramus. For a
mortal hour we sat together, almost in silence, her eyes
occasionally directed full upon me. We were for the
moment relieved by the entrance of a young lady, one
of the daughters of the house, who was introduced to
me. But, alas! we got on no better than before. The
young lady sat with downcast eyes, intent upon her
knitting, though I saw that her eyes were black, and
that she was pretty.</p>

<p>Then the master of the house came home, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
had dinner in a quiet, sober fashion. In the evening
the lady and I made a few further efforts at conversation.
I was looking at the books on the drawing-room
table, when she all at once brightened up, and asked&mdash;"Have
you ever heard of Robbie Burns?" I answered
(I fear rather chaffingly) that "I had once heard there
was such a person." "Have you, tho'?" said the lady,
relapsing into crochet. The gentleman went off to sleep,
and the young lady continued absorbed in her knitting.
A little later in the evening the hostess made a further
effort. "Have you ever tasted whisky toddy?" To
which I answered, "Yes, once or twice," at which she
seemed astonished. But the whisky toddy, which might
have put a little spirit into the evening, did not make
its appearance. The subject of the recent marriage
festivity having come up, the lady was amazed to find I
had been there, and that I was fond of dancing! I fear
this sent me down a great many more pegs in her estimation.
In fact, my evening was a total failure, and I
was glad to get to bed&mdash;though it was an immense
expanse of bed, big enough for a dozen people.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, next morning I went
with the family to "the kirk," heard an awfully long
sermon, during which I nipped my fingers to keep
myself awake; and as soon as I could I made my
escape back to my lodgings, very well pleased to get
away, but feeling that I must have left a very unfavourable
impression upon the minds of my worthy
entertainers.</p>

<p>I had now been in Melbourne some weeks, and the
question arose&mdash;What next? I found the living rather
expensive, and that it was making a steady drain upon
my funds. I had the option of a passage home, or of
staying in the colony if I could find some employment
wherewith to occupy myself profitably in the meanwhile.
But I could not remain much longer idle,
merely going about visiting and enjoying myself.</p>

<p>I took an opportunity of consulting the eminent
physician, Dr. Halford, who pronounced my lungs
sound, but recommended me, because of the sudden
changes of temperature to which Melbourne is liable,
either to return home immediately, in order to establish
the benefit I had derived from the voyage, or, if I
remained, to proceed up country, north of the Dividing
Range, where the temperature is more equable.</p>

<p>I accordingly determined to make the attempt to
obtain some settled employment in the colony that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
might enable me to remain in it a little longer. I
found that there were many fellows, older and more
experienced than myself, who had been knocking about
Melbourne for some time, unable to find berths. It
is quite natural that the young men of the colony,
desirous of entering merchants' houses, banks, or insurance
offices, should have the preference over new
comers; and hence those young men who come here,
expecting to drop into clerk's offices, soon find themselves
<i>de trop</i>, and that they are a drug in the
market.</p>

<p>The prospect of obtaining such employment in my
own case did not, therefore, look very bright; yet I
could but try and fail, as others had done. In the last
event there was the passage home, of which I could
avail myself. Well, I tried, and tried again, and at last
succeeded, thanks to the friendly gentlemen in Melbourne
who so kindly interested themselves in my
behalf. In my case luck must have helped me: for I
am sure I did not owe my success to any special knowledge.
But happy I was when, after a great deal of
running about, it was at length communicated to me
that there was a vacancy in an up-country branch of
one of the principal colonial banking companies, which
was open to my acceptance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;"><a href="images/image078-lg.png">
<img src="images/image078.png" width="379" height="600" alt="Map of the Gold-Mining District, Victoria." title="Map of the Gold-Mining District, Victoria." />
</a><span class="caption">Map of the Gold-Mining District, Victoria.</span>
</p>

<p>I took the position at once, and made my arrangements
for starting to enter upon the duties of the office
forthwith. I of course knew nothing of the country in
which the branch bank was situated, excepting that it
was in what is called a digging township&mdash;that is, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
township in which digging for gold is the principal
branch of industry. When I told my companions what
occupation I had before me, and where I was going,
they tried to frighten me. They pictured to me a
remote place, with a few huts standing on a gravelly
hill, surrounded by holes and pools of mud. "A
wretched life you will lead up there," they said;
"depend upon it, you will never be able to bear it,
and we shall see you back in Melbourne within a
month, disgusted with up-country life." "Well, we
shall see," I said: "I am resolved to give it a fair
trial, and in the worst event I can go home by the
next Money Wigram."</p>

<p>After the lapse of two days from the date of my
appointment, I was at the Spencer Street Station of
the Victoria Railway, and booked for Castlemaine, a
station about eighty miles from Melbourne. Two of
my fellow-passengers by the 'Yorkshire' were there
to see me off, wishing me all manner of kind things.
Another parting, and I was off up-country. What
would it be like? What sort of people were they
amongst whom I was to live? What were to be my
next experiences?</p>

<p>We sped rapidly over the flat, lowly-undulating,
and comparatively monotonous country north of Melbourne,
until we reached the Dividing Range, a mountainous
chain, covered with dark-green scrub, separating
Bourke from Dalhousie County, where the scenery
became more varied and interesting.</p>

<p>In the railway-carriage with me was a boy of about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
twelve or fourteen, who at once detected in me a "new
chum," as recent arrivals in the colony are called.
We entered into conversation, when I found he was
going to Castlemaine, where he lived. He described it
as a large up-country town, second only to Ballarat and
Melbourne. But I was soon about to see the place with
my own eyes, for we were already approaching it; and
before long I was set down at the Castlemaine Station,
from whence I was to proceed to my destination by
coach.</p>

<p>The town of Castlemaine by no means came up to
the description of my travelling companion. Perhaps
I had expected too much, and was disappointed. The
place is built on the site of what was once a very great
rush, called Forest Creek. Gold was found in considerable
abundance, and attracted a vast population
into the neighbourhood. But other and richer fields
having been discovered, the rush went elsewhere,
leaving behind it the deposit of houses now known as
Castlemaine.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It contains but few streets, and those
not very good ones. The houses are mostly small and
low; the greater number are only one-storied erections.
Everything was quiet, with very little traffic going on,
and the streets had a most dead-alive look.</p>

<p>The outskirts of the town presented a novel appearance.
Small heaps of gravelly soil, of a light-red
colour, lying close to each other, covered the
ground in all directions, almost as far as the eye could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
reach. The whole country seemed to have been turned
over, dug about, and abandoned; though I still observed
here and there pools of red muddy water, and
a few men digging, searching for gold amongst the
old workings.</p>

<p>I put up at one of the hotels, to wait there until the
coach started at midnight. The place was very dull,
the streets were very dull, and everybody seemed to
have gone to bed. At length the hours passed, and the
coach drew up. It was an odd-looking vehicle, drawn
by four horses. The body was simply hung on by
straps, innocent of springs. There were no windows
to the carriage, but only leather aprons in their place.
This looked rather like rough travelling.</p>

<p>Away we went at last, at a good pace, over a tolerably
good road. Soon, however, we began to jolt and
pitch about, the carriage rolling and rocking from side
to side. There was only one passenger besides myself,
a solitary female, who sat opposite to me. I held on
tight to the woodwork of the coach, but, notwithstanding
all my efforts, I got pitched into the lady's
lap more than once. She seemed to take it all
very coolly, however, as if it were a mere matter of
course.</p>

<p>After changing horses twice, and after a good deal
more jolting, the road became better and smoother;
and then I observed, from the signs outside, that we
were approaching a considerable place. I was told that
it was Maryborough, and shortly after the coach pulled
up at the door of an hotel and I alighted. It was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
between four and five in the morning, so I turned into
bed and had a sound sleep.</p>

<p>I was wakened up by a young gentleman, who introduced
himself to me as one of my future "camarades"
in the bank, to whom my arrival had been telegraphed.
After making a good breakfast I stepped on to the
verandah in front of the hotel, and the high street of
Maryborough lay before me. It seemed a nice, tidy
town. The streets were white and clean; the shops,
now open, were some of brick, and others of wood.
The hotel in which I had slept was a two-storied brick
building. Two banks were in the main street, one of
them a good building. Everything looked spic-and-span
new, very unlike our old-fashioned English country
towns.</p>

<p>The township to which I was destined being distant
about six miles from Maryborough, I was driven thither
in the evening,&mdash;full of wonderment and curiosity as
to the place to which I was bound. As we got outside
Maryborough into the open country, its appearance
struck me very much. It was the first time I had
been amongst the gum-trees, which grow so freely in
all the southern parts of Australia.</p>

<p>For a short distance out of the town the road was a
made one, passing through some old workings, shown
by the big holes and heaps of gravel that lay about.
Further on, it became a mere hardened track, through
amongst trees and bushes, each driver choosing his own
track. As soon as one becomes the worse for wear,
and the ruts in it are worn too deep, a new one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
selected. Some of these old ruts have a very ugly look.
Occasionally we pass a cottage with a garden, but no
village is in sight. The brown trees have a forlorn
look; the pointed leaves seem hardly to cover them.
The bushes, too, that grow by the road-side, seem
straggling and scraggy: but, then, I must remember
that it is winter-time in Australia.</p>

<p>At length we reach the top of a hill, from which
there is a fine view of the country beyond. I have a
vivid recollection of my first glimpse of a landscape
which afterwards became so familiar to me. The dark
green trees stretched down into the valley and clothed
the undulating ground which lay toward the right.
Then, on the greener and flatter-looking country in
front, there seemed to extend a sort of whitish line&mdash;something
that I could not quite make out. At first I
thought it must be a town in the distance, with its
large white houses. In the blue of the evening I
could not then discern that what I took to be houses
were simply heaps of pipeclay. Further off, and beyond
all, was a background of brown hills, fading
away in the distance. Though it was winter time,
the air was bright and clear, and the blue sky was
speckled with fleecy clouds.</p>

<p>But we soon lose sight of the distant scene, as we
rattle along through the dust down-hill. We reach
another piece of made road, indicating our approach to
a town; and very shortly we arrive at a small township
close by a creek. We pass a shed, in which
stampers are at work, driven by steam,&mdash;it is a quartz-mill;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
then a blacksmith's shop; then an hotel, and
other houses. I supposed this was to be my location;
but, no! The driver turns sharp off the high road
down towards the creek. It is a narrow stream of
dirty-coloured water, trickling along between two high
banks. We drive down the steep on one side and up
the other with a tremendous pull, the buggy leaning
heavily to one side. On again, over a crab-holey
plain, taking care to avoid the stumps of trees and
bad ground. Now we are in amongst the piles of dirt
which mark abandoned diggings.</p>

<p>Another short bit of made road, and we are in the
township. It is still sufficiently light to enable me to
read "Council Chambers" over the door of a white-painted,
shed-like, wooden erection of one story. Then
up the street, past the shops with their large canvas
signs, until at length we pull up alongside a wooden
one-storied house, roofed with iron, and a large wooden
verandah projecting over the pathway in front. The
signboard over the door tells me this is the Bank. I
have reached my destination, and am safely landed in
the town of Majorca.</p>

<p>In my school-days Majorca was associated in my mind
with "Minorca and Ivica," and I little thought to encounter
a place of that name in Australia. It seems
that the town was originally so called because of its
vicinity to a rocky point called Gibraltar, where gold
had been found some time before. Like many other
towns up country, the founding of Majorca was the
result of a rush.</p>

<p>In the early days of gold-digging, when men were
flocking into the colony to hunt for treasure, so soon
as the news got abroad of a great nugget being found
by some lucky adventurers, or of some rich gold-bearing
strata being struck, there was a sudden rush from all
quarters to the favoured spot. Such a rush occurred
at Majorca in the year 1863.</p>

<p>Let me try to describe the scene in those early days
of the township, as it has been related to me by those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
who witnessed it. Fancy from fourteen to fifteen thousand
diggers suddenly drawn together in one locality,
and camped out in the bush within a radius of a mile
and a half.</p>

<p>A great rush is a scene of much bustle and excitement.
Long lines of white tents overtop the heaps of
pipeclay, which grow higher from day to day. The
men are hard at work on these hills of "mullock,"
plying the windlasses by which the stuff is brought up
from below, or puddling and washing off "the dirt."
Up come the buckets from the shafts, down which
the diggers are working, and the dirty yellow water is
poured down-hill to find its way to the creek as it best
may. Unmade roads, or rather tracks, run in and out
amongst the claims, knee-deep in mud; the ground
being kept in a state of constant sloppiness by the
perpetual washing for the gold. Perhaps there is a
fight going on over the boundary-pegs of a claim
which have been squashed by a heavy dray passing
along, laden with stores from Castlemaine.</p>

<p>The miners are attended by all manner of straggling
followers, like the sutlers following a camp.
The life is a very rough one: hard work and hard
beds, heavy eating and heavy drinking. The diggers
mostly live in tents, for they are at first too much
engrossed by their search for gold to run up huts;
but many of them sleep in the open air or under the
shelter of the trees. A pilot-coat or a pea-jacket is
protection enough for those who do not enjoy the
luxury of a tent; but the dryness and geniality of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
climate are such that injury is very rarely experienced
from the night exposure. There are very few women
at the first opening of new diggings, the life is too
rough and rude; and some of those who do come, rock
the cradle&mdash;but not the household one&mdash;with the men.
The diggers, however genteel the life they may have
led before, soon acquire a dirty, rough, unshaven look.
Their coarse clothes are all of a colour, being that of
the clay and gravel in which they work, and the mud
with which they become covered when digging.</p>

<p>There is a crowd of men at an open bar drinking.
Bar, indeed! It is but a plank supported on two
barrels; and across this improvised counter the brandy
bottle and glasses are eagerly plied. A couple of old
boxes in front serve for seats, while a piece of canvas,
rigged on two poles, shades off the fierce sun. Many
a large fortune has been made at a rude bar of this
sort. For too many of the diggers, though they work
like horses, spend like asses. Here, again, in the
long main street of tents, where the shafts are often
uncomfortably close to the road, the tradesmen are
doing a roaring business. Stalwart men, with stout
appetites, are laying in their stores of grocery, buying
pounds of flour, sugar, and butter&mdash;meat and bread in
great quantities. The digger thrusts his parcels indiscriminately
into the breast of his dirty jumper, a thick
shirt; and away he goes, stuffed with groceries, and
perhaps a leg of mutton over his shoulder. In the
evening some four thousand camp fires in the valleys,
along the gullies, and up the sides of the hills, cast a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
lurid light over a scene, which, once witnessed, can
never be forgotten.</p>

<p>There were, of course, the usual rowdies at Majorca
as at other rushes. But very soon a rough discipline
was set up and held them in check; then a local
government was formed; and eventually order was
established. Although the neighbouring towns look
down on "little Majorca"&mdash;say it is the last place made&mdash;and
tell of the riotous doings at its first settlement,
Majorca is quoted by Brough Smyth, whose book on
the gold-fields is the best authority on the subject,
as having been a comparatively orderly place, even in
the earliest days of the rush. He says, "Shortly after
the workings were opened, it presented a scene of busy
industry, where there was more of order, decency, and
good behaviour than could probably be found in any
mining locality in England, or on the Continent of
Europe."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The contrast, however, must be very great between
the Majorca of to-day and the Majorca of seven years
since, when it was a great gold-diggers' camp. It had
its first burst, like all other celebrated places in the
gold-fields. As the shallower and richer ground became
worked out, the diggers moved off to some new
diggings, and the first glories of the Majorca rush gradually
passed away. Still, the place continued prosperous.
The mining was carried down into deeper strata.
But after a few years, the yield fell off, and the engines
were gradually withdrawn. Some few claims are doing
well in new offshoots of the lead, and the miners are
vigorously following it up. Two engine companies are
pushing ahead and hoping for better things. Over at
the other side of the creek, in amongst the ranges,
there is still plenty of fair yielding quartz, which is
being got out of mother earth; and the miners consider
that they have very fair prospects before them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, Majorca has subsided into a comparatively
quiet country place, containing about 800 inhabitants.
It is supported in a great measure by the adjoining
farming population. And I observed, during my stay
at the place, that the more prudent of the miners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
when they had saved a few hundred pounds&mdash;and
some saved much more&mdash;usually retired from active
digging, and took to farming. The town consists,
for the most part, of one long street, situated on a
rising ground. There are not many buildings of importance
in it. The houses are mostly of wood, one-storied,
and roofed with corrugated iron. There is
only one brick shop-front in the street, which so over-tops
the others, that malicious, perhaps envious, neighbours
say it is sure to topple down some day on to
the footway. The shops are of the usual description,
grocers, bakers, butchers, and drapers; and the most
frequent style of shop is a store, containing everything
from a pickaxe and tin dish (for gold washing) to
Perry Davis's patent Pain-killer. We have of course
our inns&mdash;the Imperial, where the manager of the
bank and myself lived; the Harp of Erin, the Irish
rendezvous, as its name imports, even its bar-room
being papered with green; the German Hotel, where
the Verein is held, and over which the German tri-coloured
flag floats on f&ecirc;te-days; and there is also a
Swiss restaurant, the Guillaume Tell, with the Swiss
flag and cap of liberty painted on its white front.</p>

<p>I must also mention the churches, standing off the
main street, which are the most prominent buildings
in Majorca. The largest is the Wesleyan Chapel, a
substantial brick building, near which still stands the
old wooden shanty first erected and used in the time
of the rush. Then there is the Church of England,
a neat though plain edifice, well fitted and arranged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
The Presbyterians worship in a battered-looking wooden
erection; and the Roman Catholics have a shed-like
place, which in week days is used as a school.</p>

<p>Our inns and our churches will give you some idea
of the population of Majorca. I should say the
most of it&mdash;the substance&mdash;is English. The Irish are
hard workers, but generally spendthrifts, though there
are some excellent exceptions. The Irish hold together
in religion, politics, and drink. The Scotch are not
so numerous as the Irish, but somehow they have
a knack of getting on. They are not clannish like
the Irish. Each hangs by his own hook. Then there
are the Germans, who are pretty numerous, a very
respectable body of men, with a sprinkling of Italians
and Swiss. The Germans keep up their old country
fashions, hold their Verein, meet and make speeches,
sing songs, smoke pipes, and drink thin wine. Lager-beer
has not reached them yet.</p>

<p>The building in Majorca in which I am, of course,
most of all interested, is that in which I officiate as
"Accountant," the only other officer in the bank being
the "Manager." You will thus observe that there
are only officers in our establishment&mdash;all rank and
no file. Let me give you an idea of our building.
Its walls are wooden, with canvas inside, and its roof
is of corrugated iron. The office fronts the main
street, and is fitted with a plain counter facing the
door, at one end of which are the gold-weighing scales,
and at the other the ledger-desk. Two rooms are
attached to the office, in which we sleep,&mdash;one behind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the other at the side. There is a pretty little garden
in the rear, a verandah covered with a thickly growing
Australian creeper (the Dolichos), sheltering us as we
sit out there occasionally, enjoying the quiet cool of
the evenings, reading or talking.</p>

<p>You will thus observe that our establishment is by
no means of a stately order.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Indeed the place is not
weather-proof. When the wind blows, the canvas
inside the boards flaps about, and, in my queer little
sleeping-room, when the rain falls it runs down the
sides of the canvas walls, and leaves large stains upon
the gay paper. But I contrived to make the little
place look tolerably comfortable; hung it round with
photographs reminding me of relations and friends at
home, and at length I came quite to enjoy my little
retreat.</p>

<p>A look up and down the main street of Majorca is
not particularly lively at any time. Some of the shop-keepers
are in front of their stores, standing about
under the verandahs which cover the pathway, and
lazily enjoying a pipe. At the upper end of the town
the blacksmith is busily at work shoeing some farmer's
horses, in front of the blazing smithy fire. Five or
six diggers come slouching along, just from their work,
in their mud-bespattered trowsers and their shirt
sleeves, a pick or spade over their shoulders, and a tin
"billy" in their hands. But for the occasional rattle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of a cart or buggy down the street, the town would be
lapped in quiet.</p>

<p>Here comes a John Chinaman with his big basket
of vegetables. And let me tell you that the Chinamen,
who live in the neighbourhood of the town, form
no unimportant part of our community. But for them
where should we be for our cabbages, cauliflowers,
and early potatoes? They are the most indefatigable
and successful of gardeners. Every morning three or
four of them are seen coming into the town from their
large gardens near the creek, each with a pole across
his shoulders, and a heavily laden basket hanging from
each end. What tremendous loads they contrive to
carry in this way! Try to lift one of their baskets,
and you will find you can hardly raise it from the
ground. Then you see the "Johns" moving along
from house to house, selling their stuffs. It takes a
very clever woman to get the better of one of the
Chinamen in a bargain. I found, by watching closely,
that those got best off who chose what they wanted
out of the basket, paid what they thought a fair price,
and stuck to their purchase. John would at last
agree, but go away grumbling.</p>

<p>Of course there is not much in the way of what is
called "society" at this place. Like all the new towns
in Australia, it consists for the most part of a settlement
of working people. Australia may, however, be regarded
as the paradise of working men, when they choose to
avail themselves of the advantages which it offers.
Here there is always plenty of profitable work for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
industrious. Even Chinamen get rich. The better
sort of working families live far more comfortably than
our clerking or business young men do at home. The
respectable workman belongs to the Mechanics' Institute,
where there is a very good circulating library; he
dresses well on Sundays, and goes to church; hires a
horse and takes a pleasure ride into the bush on
holidays; puts money in the bank, and when he has
accumulated a fund, builds a house for himself, or buys
a lot of land and takes to farming. Any steady working
man can do all this here, and without any difficulty.</p>

<p>Where the digger or mechanic does not thrive and
save money, the fault is entirely due to his own improvidence.
Living is cheap. Clothes are dear, but the
workman does not need to wear expensive clothes; and
food is reasonable. Good mutton sells at 3<i>d.</i> a pound,
and bread at 6<i>d.</i> the four pound loaf. Thanks to the
Chinamen also, vegetables are moderate in price. Every
one may, therefore, save money if he has the mind to
do so. But many spendthrifts seem to feel it a sort of
necessity to throw away their money as soon as they
have earned it. Of course, the chief source of waste
here, as at home, is drink. There is constant "shouting"
for drinks&mdash;that is, giving drinks all round to my acquaintances
who may be present. And as one shouts,
so another follows with his shout, and thus a great deal
of drink is swallowed. Yet, I must say that, though
there may be more drinking here than in England,
there is much less drunkenness. I have very seldom
seen a man really drunk during my stay in Majorca.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Perhaps the pure dry atmosphere may have something
to do with it. But often, also, when there is a shout,
the call of many may be only for lemonade, or some
simple beverage of that sort. It must also be stated,
as a plea for men resorting so much as they do to
public-houses, that there are few other places where
they can meet and exchange talk with each other.</p>

<p>That everybody may thrive here who will, is evident
from the utter absence of beggars in Australia. I
have not seen one regular practitioner. An occasional
"tramp" may be encountered hard up, and in search of
work. He may ask for assistance. He can have a glass
of beer at a bar, with a crust of bread, by asking for it.
And he goes on his way, most likely getting the employment
of which he is in search at the next township.
The only beggars I ever encountered at Majorca are
genteel ones&mdash;the people who come round with lists,
asking for subscriptions in aid of bazaars for the building
of churches and the like. Nor did I find much
of that horrid "tipping" which is such a nuisance in
England. You may "shout" a liquor if you choose,
but "tipping" would be considered an insult.</p>

<p>There is an almost entire absence of coppers up
country; the lowest change is a threepenny bit, and
you cannot well spend anything under a sixpence. I
never had any copper in my pocket, except only a
lucky farthing. Many asked me for it, to keep as a
curiosity, saying they had never seen one since they
left home. But I would not part with my farthing.</p>

</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"I need only now speak of Majorca.
Here a prospecting shaft
was bottomed in the beginning of
March, 1863, in the middle of a
very extensive plain, known as
M'Cullum's Creek Plain. The
depth of the shaft was 85 feet,
through thick clay, gravel, and
cement. The wash-dirt was white
gravel, intermixed with heavy
boulders, on a soft pipeclay bottom;
its thickness being from 2 to 3 feet.
It averaged in some places 3 oz. to
the load. Finally, a rush set in,
and before three months had
elapsed there were more than
15,000 miners on the ground. The
sinking became deeper as the work
went on, and was so wet that
whims had to be erected; and at
one time, in 1865, over 170 might
have been seen at work, both night
and day. Subsequently steam
machinery was procured, and now
no less than ten engines, varying
from 15-&nbsp;to 20-horse power, are
constantly employed in pumping,
winding, and puddling. The lead
in its lower part is 160 feet in
depth, and is evidently extending
towards the Carisbrook, Moolart,
and Charlotte plains, where so
much is expected by all scientific
men."&mdash;<i>Mr. E. O'Farrell, formerly

<p>There is no difficulty in making friends in Victoria.
New chums from home are always made welcome.
They are invited out and hospitably entertained by
people of all classes. But for the many kind friends
I made in Majorca and its neighbourhood I should
doubtless have spent a very dull time there. As it
was, the eighteen months I lived up country passed
pleasantly and happily.</p>

<p>The very first Sunday I spent in Majorca I "dined
out." I had no letters of introduction, and therefore
did not owe my dinner to influence, but to mere free-and-easy
hospitality. Nor did the party with which I
dined belong to the first circles, where letters of introduction
are of any use; for they were only a party of
diggers. I will explain how it happened.</p>

<p>After church my manager invited me to a short walk
in the neighbourhood. We went in the direction of
M'Cullum's Creek, about a mile distant. This was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
village at the creek which I passed on the evening of
my first drive from Maryborough. Crossing the creek,
we went up into the range of high ground beyond; and
from the top of the hill we had a fine view of the
surrounding country. Majorca lay below, glistening
amidst its hillocks of pipeclay. The atmosphere was
clear, and the sky blue and cloudless. Though the town
was two miles distant, I could read some of the names
on the large canvas sign-boards over the hotel doors;
and with the help of an opera-glass, I easily distinguished
the windows of a house six miles off. The day
was fine and warm, though it was mid-winter in June;
for it must be borne in mind that the seasons are
reversed in this southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Descending the farther side of the hill, we dropped into
a gully, where we shortly came upon a little collection of
huts roofed with shingle. The residents were outside,
some amusing themselves with a cricket-ball, while
others were superintending the cooking of their dinners
at open fires outside the huts. One of the men having
recognized my companion, a conversation took place,
which was followed by an invitation to join them at
dinner. As we were getting rather peckish after our
walk, we readily accepted their offered hospitality.
The mates took turn and turn about at the cooking,
and when dinner was pronounced to be ready, we went
into the hut.</p>

<p>The place was partitioned off into two rooms, one
of which was a sleeping apartment, and the other
the dining-room. It was papered with a gay-coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
paper, and photographs of friends were stuck up
against the wall. We were asked to be seated. To
accommodate the strangers, an empty box and a
billet of wood were introduced from the outside. I
could not say the table was laid, for it was guiltless
of a table-cloth; indeed all the appointments were
rather rough. When we were seated, one of the
mates, who acted as waiter, brought in the smoking
dishes from the fire outside, and set them before us.
The dinner consisted of roast beef and cauliflower, and
a capital dinner it was, for our appetites were keen,
and hunger is the best of sauces. We were told that
on Sundays the men usually had pudding; but "Bill,"
who was the cook that week, was pronounced to be "no
hand at a plum duff." We contrived, however, to do
very well without it.</p>

<p>I afterwards found that the men were very steady
fellows&mdash;three of them English and one a German.
They worked at an adjoining claim; and often afterwards
I saw them at our bank, selling their gold, or
depositing their savings.</p>

<p>After dinner we had a ramble through the bush with
our hosts, and then, towards dusk, we wended our way
back to the township. Such was my first experience of
diggers' hospitality in Australia, and it was by no
means the last.</p>

<p>Another afternoon we made an excursion to the
Chinamen's gardens, which lie up the creek, under
the rocky point of Gibraltar, about a mile and a half
distant from the township. We went through the lead&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
is, the course which the gold takes underground,
and which can be traced by the old workings. Where
the gold lies from five to seven feet beneath the surface,
the whole ground is turned over to get at it. But
where the gold-bearing stratum lies from fifty to two
hundred feet deep, and shafts have to be sunk, the
remains of the old workings present a very different
appearance. Then mounds of white clay and gravel,
from twenty to forty feet high, lie close together&mdash;sometimes
not more than fifteen feet apart. Climb
up to the top of one of these mounds, and you can see
down the deserted shaft which formerly led to the
working ground below. Look round; see the immense
quantity of heaps, and the extent of ground they cover,
almost as far as the eye can reach up the lead, and
imagine the busy scene which the place must have
presented in the earlier days of the rush, when each of
these shafts was fitted with its windlass, and each
mound was covered with toiling men. In one place a
couple of engine-sheds still remain, a gaunt erection
supporting the water-tanks; the poppet-heads towering
above all, still fitted with the wheels that helped to
bring the gold to the surface. How deserted and desolate
the place looks! An abandoned rush must be as
melancholy a sight to a miner as a deserted city to a
townsman. But all is not dead yet. Not far off you
can see jets of white steam coming up from behind
the high white mounds on the new lead, showing that
miners are still actually at work in the neighbourhood;
nor are they working without hope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through the abandoned claims, we shortly
found ourselves on the brow of the hill overlooking
the Chinamen's gardens, of which we had come in
search, and, dipping into the valley, we were soon
in front of them. They are wonderfully neat and
well kept. The oblong beds are raised some ten
inches above the level of the walks, and the light and
loamy earth is kept in first-rate condition. The Chinamen
are far less particular about their huts, which
are both poor and frail. Some of them are merely of
canvas, propped up by gum-tree branches, to protect
them from the wind and weather. But John has more
substantial dwellings than these, for here, I observe, is
a neat little cluster of huts, one in the centre being a
well-constructed weatherboard, with a real four-paned
glass window in it.</p>

<p>Crossing the ditch surrounding the gardens upon a
tottering plank, and opening the little gate, we went
in. The Chinamen were, as usual, busily at work.
Some were hoeing the light soil, and others, squatted
on their haunches, were weeding. They looked up
and wished us "Good evening" as we passed along.
Near the creek, which bounded one end of the ground,
a John was hauling up water from the well; I took a
turn at the windlass, and must confess that I found the
work very hard.</p>

<p>The young vegetables are reared with the greatest
care, and each plant is sedulously watched and attended
to. Here is a John, down on his haunches, with a
pot of white mixture and a home-manufactured brush,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
painting over the tender leaves of some young cabbages,
to save them from blight. He has to go through
some hundreds of them in this way. Making our way
into one of the larger huts, we stroll into the open
door, and ask a more important-looking man if he has
any water-melon? We get a splendid one for "four-pin,"
and have a delicious "<i>gouter</i>." Our host&mdash;a little,
dry, withered-up fellow, dressed in a soiled blue cotton
jacket, and wide trowsers which flap about his ankles&mdash;collects
the rind for his fowls. The hard-beaten ground
is the only flooring of the hut, and the roof is simply of
bark.</p>

<p>In one of the corners of the cabin was a most
peculiar-looking affair, very like a Punch and Judy
show. On the proscenium, as it were, large Chinese
letters were painted. Inside was an image or idol (the
joss), carved in wood, with gorgeous gilded paper stuck
all round him. A small crowd of diminutive Chinamen
knelt before him, doing homage. On the ledge
before the little stage was a glass of <i>porter</i> for the
idol to drink, and some rice and fruit to satisfy his
appetite. Numerous Chinese candles, like our wax
tapers, were put up all round inside, and the show,
when lit up, must have looked very curious.</p>

<p>The Chinamen are always pleased at any notice
taken of their houses, so we penetrated a little further
into the dwelling. In one little room we found a young
fellow reading a Chinese book with English words
opposite the characters. It seemed a sort of primer or
word-book. My friend having asked the Chinaman to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
give us some music on an instrument hanging above
him, which looked something like our banjo, he proceeded
to give us some celestial melodies. The tunes
were not bad, being in quick time, not unlike an Irish
jig, but the chords were most strange. He next played
a tune on the Chinese fiddle, very thin and squeaky.
The fiddle consists of a long, straight piece of wood, with
a cross-piece fixed on to the end of it. Two strings
stretch from the tip of the cross-piece to the end of
the long piece. The instrument is rested on the knee,
and the gut of the bow, which is between the two
strings, is drawn first across one and then the other.
An invisible vocalist, in the adjoining cabin, gave us
a song to the accompaniment of the violin. I should
imagine that it was a sentimental song, as it sounded
very doleful; it must surely have been the tune that
the old cow died of!</p>

<p>We were now in the bedroom, which was a most
quaint affair. You must not imagine that the Chinamen
sleep on beds at all&mdash;at least the Chinamen here
do not. A wooden stretcher, covered with fine straw
matting, is sufficient for their purpose. The room was
lit by a small window; the walls were decorated with
a picture or two from the 'Illustrated London News,'
placed side by side with Chinese likenesses of charming
small-footed ladies, gaudily dressed in blues and
yellows.</p>

<p>In another adjoining hut we found a Chinaman
whom we knew,&mdash;a man who comes to the bank
occasionally to sell us gold. He was cooking his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
supper, squatting over the fire, with an old frying-pan
containing something that looked very like dried
worms frizzling in fat. "Welly good" he told us
it was; and very good he seemed to be making
it, as he added slice after slice of cucumber to the
mixture. John showed us the little worm-like things
before they were put in the pan, and he told us they
came "all the way Canton." He offered us, by way of
refreshment, his very last drop of liquor from a bottle
that was labelled, "Burnett's Fine Old Tom," which he
kept, I suppose, for his private consumption. John's
mates shortly after came in to their meal, when we
retired&mdash;I with a cucumber in my pocket, which he
gave me as a present, and a very good one it was. I
often afterwards went over to see the Chinamen, they
were so quaint and funny in their ways.</p>

<p>I observe that in the cemetery the Chinamen have
a separate piece of burying-ground apportioned to
them. There their bodies are interred; but only to be
dug up again, enclosed in boxes, and returned to China
for final burial; the prejudice said to prevail amongst
them being that if their bones do not rest in China
their souls cannot enter Paradise. Not only are they
careful that their bodies, but even that bits of their
bodies, should be returned to their native land. There
was a Chinaman in Majorca whom I knew well, that
had his finger taken off by an accident. Shortly after,
he left the township; but, three months after, he one
day made his appearance at our bank. I asked him
where he had been, and why he had come back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Majorca? "Oh!" said he, holding up his hand, "me
come look after my finger." "Where is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! me put 'em in the ground in bush&mdash;me know."
And I have no doubt he recovered his member, and
went away happy.</p>

<p>My greatest pleasure, while at Majorca, was in riding
or walking through the bush&mdash;that is, the country as
Nature made it and left it&mdash;still uncleared and unoccupied,
except by occasional flocks of sheep, the property
of the neighbouring squatters. North of Majorca
lies a fine tract of country which we call the high
plains, for we have to cross a creek and climb a high hill
before we get on to them. Then for an invigorating
gallop over the green turf, the breeze freshening as we
pace along. These plains are really wonderful. They
look like a large natural amphitheatre, being level for
about fifteen miles in every direction and encircled all
round by high hills. There is very little timber on
the plains.</p>

<p>The bush covers the ranges of hills between Majorca
and these plains or lower grounds, amidst which the
creeks run. Here, in some places, the trees grow pretty
thickly; in others, the country is open and naturally
clear. There is, however, always enough timber about
to confuse the traveller unless he knows the track.</p>

<p>Shortly after my settling in Majorca, having heard
that one of my fellow-passengers by the 'Yorkshire' was
staying with a squatter about fourteen miles off, I determined
to pay him a visit. I thought I knew the track
tolerably well; but on my way through the bush I got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
confused, and came to the conclusion that I had lost my
way. When travellers get lost, they usually "<i>coo-ee</i>"
at the top of their voice, and the prolonged note, rising
at the end, is heard at a great distance in the silence of
the bush. I <i>coo-ied</i> as loud as I could, and listened;
but there was no response. I rode on again, and at
length I thought I heard a sort of hammering noise in
the distance. I proceeded towards it, and found the
noise occasioned by a man chopping wood. Glad to
find I was not yet lost, I went up to him to ask my
way. To my surprise, he could not speak a word of
English. I tried him in German, I tried him in French.
No! What was he, then? I found, by his <i>patois</i>, a
few words of which I contrived to make out, that he
was a Savoyard, who had only very recently arrived in
the colony. By dint of signs, as much as words, I
eventually made out the direction in which I was to go
in order again to find the track that I had missed, and
I took leave of my Savoyard with thanks.</p>

<p>I succeeded in recovering the track, and eventually
reached the squatter's house in which my friend resided.
It was a large stone building, erected in the
modern style of villa architecture. Beside it stood
the original squatter's dwelling. What a contrast they
presented! The one a tall, handsome house; the other
a little, one-storied, shingle-roofed hut, with queer
little doors and windows. My friend, as he came out
and welcomed me, asked me to guess what he had
been just doing. He had been helping to put in the
new stove in the kitchen, for the larger house is scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
yet finished. He told me what a good time he was
having: horses to ride, doing whatever he liked, and
enjoying a perfect Liberty Hall.</p>

<p>The host himself shortly made his appearance, and
gave me a cordial welcome. After dinner we walked
round and took a view of the place. Quite a little
community, I found, lived about; for our host is a
large squatter, farmer, and miller; all the people being
supplied with rations from the station store. There is
even a station church provided by the owner, and a
clergyman comes over from Maryborough every Sunday
afternoon to hold the service and preach to the people.
After a very pleasant stroll along the banks of the
pretty creek which runs near the house, I mounted
my nag, and rode slowly home in the cool of the
evening.</p>

<h3>AUSTRALIAN WINTER&mdash;THE FLOODS.</h3>

or Australian Gum-tree</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ball at Clunes</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fire in the main

at Ballarat</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Damage done by the Flood</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Chinamen's
Gardens Washed Away</span>.</p>


<p>I was particularly charmed with the climate of
Victoria. It is really a pleasure to breathe the air:
it is so pure, dry, and exhilarating. Even when the
temperature is at its highest, the evenings are delightfully
cool. There is none of that steamy, clammy,
moist heat during the day, which is sometimes so
difficult to bear in the English summer; and as for
the spring of Australia, it is simply perfection.</p>

<p>It was mid-winter when I arrived in Majorca&mdash;that
is, about the end of June, corresponding with our
English December. Although a wood-fire was very
pleasant, especially in the evenings, it was usually
warm at midday. The sky was of a bright, clear
blue, and sometimes the sun shone with considerable
power. No one would think of going out with a
great coat in winter, excepting for a long drive
through the bush or at night. In fact, the season<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
can scarcely be termed winter; it is rather like a
prolonged autumn; extending from May to August.
Snow never falls,&mdash;at least, I never saw any during the
two winters I spent in the colony; and although there
were occasional slight frosts at night in the month of
August, I never observed the ice thicker than a wafer.
I once saw a heavy shower of hail, as it might fall
in England in summer; but it melted off the ground
directly.</p>

<p>In proof of the mildness of the climate, it may
further be mentioned that the Australian vegetation
continues during the winter months. The trees remain
clothed in their usual garb, though the leaves are
of a somewhat browner hue than in the succeeding
seasons.</p>

<p>The leaves of the universal gum-tree, or Eucalyptus
of Australia, are pointed, each leaf seeming to grow
separately, and they are so disposed as to give the
least possible shade. Instead of presenting one surface
to the sky and the other to the earth, as is the case
with the trees of Europe, they are often arranged
vertically, so that both sides are equally exposed to
the light. Thus the gum-tree has a pointed and sort
of angular appearance, the leaves being thrust out in
all directions and at every angle. The blue-gum and
some others have the peculiarity of throwing off their
bark in white-grey longitudinal strips or ribands,
which, hanging down the branches, give them a singularly
ragged look, more particularly in winter. From
this description, it will be gathered that the gum-tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is not a very picturesque tree; nevertheless, I have
seen some in the far bush which were finely proportioned,
tall, and might even be called handsome.</p>

<p>The fine winter weather continues for months, the
days being dry and fine, with clear blue sky overhead,
until about the end of August, when rain begins to
fall pretty freely. During the first winter I spent at
Majorca, very little rain fell during two months, and
the country was getting parched, cracked, and brown.
Then everybody prayed for rain, for the sake of the
flocks and herds, and the growing crops. At last the
rain came, and it came with a vengeance.</p>

<p>It so happened that about the middle of October I
was invited to accompany a friend to a ball given at
Clunes, a township about fifteen miles distant; and
we decided to accept the invitation. As there had
been no rain to speak of for months, the tracks through
the bush were dry and hard. We set off in the afternoon
in a one-horse buggy, and got down to Clunes
safely before it was dark.</p>

<p>Clunes is a rather important place, the centre of a
considerable gold-mining district. Like most new up-country
towns, it consists of one long street; and this
one long street is situated in a deep hollow, close to a
creek. The creek was now all but dry, like the other
creeks or rivers in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The ball was given, in a large square building belonging
to the Rechabites, situated in the upper part
of the town. The dancing began about half-past nine,
and was going on very briskly, when there was a sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
cry of "fire." All rushed to the door; and sure enough
there was a great fire raging down the street, about a
quarter of a mile off. A column of flames shot up
behind the houses, illuminating the whole town. The
gentlemen of the place hastened away to look after
their property, and the dance seemed on the point of
breaking up. I had no property to save, and I remained.
But the news came from time to time that
the fire was spreading; and here, where nearly every
house was of wood, the progress of a fire, unless
checked, is necessarily very rapid. Fears now began
to be entertained for the safety of the town.</p>

<p>The fire was said to be raging in the main street,
quite close to the principal inn. Then suddenly I
remembered that I, too, had something to look after.
There was the horse and buggy, for which my friend
and I were responsible, as well as our changes of
clothes. I ran down the street, elbowing my way
through the crowd, and reached close to where the
firemen were hard at work plying their engines. Only
two small wooden houses intervened between the fire
and the inn. I hastened into the stable, but found
my companion had been there before me. He had
got out the horse and buggy, and our property was
safe. Eight houses had been burnt down along one
side of the street, before the fire was got under.</p>

<p>After this excitement, nothing remained but to
go back and finish the dance. Our local paper at
Majorca&mdash;for you must know we have "an organ"&mdash;gave
us a hard hit, comparing us to Nero who fiddled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
while Rome was burning, whereas <i>we</i> danced while
Clunes was burning. But we did not resume the
dance till the fire was extinguished. However, everything
must come to an end, and so did the dance at
about five o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fire, the rain had begun to fall;
and it was now coming down steadily. We had nothing
for it but to drive back the fifteen miles to Majorca, as
we had to be at business by 10 o'clock. We put on
our heaviest things, and set off just as the first streaks
of daylight appeared. As we drove down the street,
we passed the smouldering remains of the fire. Where,
the night before, I had been talking to a chemist across
his counter, there was nothing but ashes; everything
had been burnt to the ground. Further on were the
charred timbers and smoking ruins of the house at
which the fire had been stayed.</p>

<p>The rain came down heavier and heavier. It seemed
to fall solid, in masses, soaking through rugs, top-coats,
and waterproofs, that we had before deemed
impervious. However, habit is everything, and when
once we got thoroughly soaked we became comparatively
indifferent to the rain, which never ceased
falling. We were soon in the bush, where there was
scarcely a track to guide us. But we hastened on,
knowing that every moment increased the risk of our
missing the way or being hindered by the flood. We
splashed along through the mud and water. As we
drove through a gully, we observed that what had
before been a dry track was now changed into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
torrent. Now hold the mare well in! We are in
the water, and it rushes against her legs as if striving
to pull her down. But she takes willingly to the
collar again, and with one more good pull lands us
safely on the other side, out of reach of the ugly,
yellow, foaming torrent.</p>

<p>By the grey light of the morning, we saw the water
pouring down the sides of the high ground as we
passed. It was clear that we must make haste if we
would reach Majorca before the waters rose. We knew
that at one part of the road we should have to drive
near the bank of the creek, which was sure to be
flooded very soon. Our object accordingly was, to push
on so as to pass this most perilous part of our journey.</p>

<p>On we drove, crossing dips in the track where
foaming streams were now rushing along, while
they roared down the gullies on either side. It was
fortunate that my companion knew the road so well:
as, in trying to avoid the deeper places, we might
have run some risk from the abandoned shafts which
lay in our way. At last we got safely across the
water, alongside the swollen creek, now raging in
fury; and glad I was when, rising the last hill, and
looking down from the summit, I saw the low-roofed
houses of Majorca before me.</p>

<p>I found that we had been more fortunate than a
party that left Clunes a little later, who had the greatest
difficulty in reaching home by reason of the flood. At
some places the gentlemen had to get out of the carriages
into the water, up to their middle, and sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the depths of the holes in advance, before allowing the
horses to proceed. And hours passed before they succeeded
in reaching their destination.</p>

<p>During the course of the day we learnt by telegraph&mdash;for
telegraphs are well established all over
the colony&mdash;that the main street of Clunes had become
turned into a river. The water was seven feet deep in
the very hotel where we had dressed for the ball!
All the back bed-rooms, stables, and outbuildings had
been washed away, and carried down the creek; and
thousands of pounds' worth of damage had been done
in the lower parts of the town.</p>

<p>A few days later, when the rain had ceased, and the
flood had subsided, I went down to Deep Creek to see
something of the damage that had been done. On
either side, a wide stretch of ground was covered by a
thick deposit of sludge, from one to four feet deep. This
was the d&eacute;bris or crushings which the rain had washed
down from the large mining claims above: and as it
was barren stuff, mere crushed quartz, it ruined for the
time every bit of land it covered. The scene which
the track along the creek presented was most pitiable.
Fences had been carried away; crops beaten down;
and huge logs lay about, with here and there bits of
furniture, houses, and farm-gear.</p>

<p>I find the floods have extended over the greater
part of the colony. Incalculable damage has been
done, and several lives have been lost. The most painful
incident of all occurred at Ballarat, where the
miners were at work on one of the claims, when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
swollen dam burst its banks and suddenly flooded the
workings. Those who were working on the top of the
shaft fled; but down below, ten of the miners were
at work at a high level, in drives many feet above
the bottom of the claim. The water soon filling up
the drives through which they had passed from the
main shaft, the men were unable to get out. They
remained there, cooped up in their narrow dark
workings, without food, or drink, or light for three
days; until at last the water was got under by the
steam-pumps, and they were reached. Two had died
of sheer privation, and the rest were got out more
dead than alive.</p>

<p>The poor Chinamen's gardens down by the creek,
under Gibraltar, had also suffered severely by the
flood. MacCullum's Creek, in ordinary seasons, is only
a tiny stream, consisting of water-holes communicating
with each other by a brook. But during a flood it
becomes converted into a raging torrent, and you can
hear its roar a mile off. Within about five hours the
water in it had risen not less than twenty feet! This will
give you an idea of the tremendous force and rapidity
of the rainfall in this country. Of course the damage
done was great, in MacCullum's as in Deep Creek.
A heavy timber bridge had been carried quite away,
not a trace of it remaining. Many miners' huts in
the low ground had been washed away; while others,
situated in more sheltered places, out of the rush of
the torrent, had been quite submerged, the occupants
saving themselves by hasty flight in the early morning;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
some of them having been only wakened up by the
water coming into their beds.</p>

<p>One eccentric character, a Scotchman, who determined
to stick to his domicile, took refuge on his
parlour table as the water was rising. Then, as it got
still higher, he placed a chair upon the table, and stood
up on it, the water continuing to rise, over his legs,
then up and up; yet still he stuck to his chair. His
only regret, he afterwards said, was that he could not
get at his whisky bottle, which he discerned upon a high
shelf temptingly opposite him, but beyond his reach.
The water at last began to fall; he waded up to his
neck for the bottle; and soon the water was out of
the house; for its fall is almost as sudden as its rise.</p>

<p>I was sorry for the poor Chinamen, whom I found,
two days later, still wandering about amidst the ruins
of their gardens. Their loamy beds had been quite
washed away, and their fences and some of their huts
carried clean down the creek. One of them told me
he had lost 30<i>l.</i> in notes, which he had concealed in his
cabin; but the flood had risen so quickly that he had
been unable to save it. I picked up a considerable-sized
stone that had been washed on to the Chinamen's
ground; it was a piece of lava thrown from one of
the volcanic hills which bound the plain,&mdash;how many
thousands of years ago! These volcanic stones are so
light and porous that they swim like corks, and they
abound in many parts of this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>After a heavy rainfall, the ground becomes well soaked
with water, and vegetation proceeds with great rapidity.
Although there may be an occasional fall of rain at
intervals, there is no recurrence of the flood. The days
are bright and clear, the air dry, and the weather most
enjoyable. It is difficult to determine when one season
begins and another ends here; but I should say that
spring begins in September. The evenings are then
warm enough to enable us to dispense with fires, while
at midday it is sometimes positively hot.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, spring time is the most delightful
season in Australia. The beautiful young vegetation
of the year is then in full progress; the orchards
are covered with blossom; the fresh, bright green of
the grass makes a glorious carpet in the bush, when the
trees put off their faded foliage of the previous year, and
assume their bright spring livery. In some places the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
bush is carpeted with flowers&mdash;violet flowers of the pea
and vetch species. There is also a beautiful plant, with
flowers of vivid scarlet, that runs along the ground;
and in some places the sarsaparillas, with their violet
flowers, hang in festoons from the gum-tree branches.
And when the wattle-bushes (a variety of the acacia
tribe) are covered over with their yellow bloom,
loading the air with their peculiarly sweet perfume,
and the wild flowers are out in their glory, a walk or a
ride through the bush is one of the most enjoyable of
pleasures.</p>

<p>I must also mention that all kinds of garden flowers,
such as we have at home, come to perfection in our
gardens here,&mdash;such as anemones, ranunculuses, ixias,
and gladiolas. All the early spring flowers&mdash;violets,
lilacs, primroses, hyacinths, and tulips&mdash;bloom most
freely. Roses also flower splendidly in spring, and
even through the summer, when not placed in too
exposed situations. At Maryborough our doctor had
a grand selection of the best roses&mdash;Lord Raglan, John
Hopper, Marshal Neil, La Reine Hortense, and such
like&mdash;which, by careful training and good watering,
grew green, thick, and strongly, and gave out a good
bloom nearly all the summer through.</p>

<p>By the beginning of November, full summer seems
already upon us, it is so hot at midday. Only towards
the evening, when the sun goes down&mdash;as it does
almost suddenly, with very little twilight&mdash;it feels a
little chilly and even cold. By the middle of the month,
however, it has grown very warm indeed, and we begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to have a touch of the hot wind from the north. I
shall not soon forget my first experience of walking in
the face of that wind. It was like encountering a blast
from the mouth of a furnace; it made my cheeks quite
tingle, and it was so dry that I felt as if the skin would
peel off.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November I found the thermometer
was 98&deg; in the shade. Try and remember if you ever had
a day in England when it was so hot, and how intolerable
it must have been! Here, however, the moisture
is absent, and we are able to bear the heat without much
inconvenience, though the fine, white dust sometimes
blows in at the open door, covering ledger, cash-book,
and everything. On the 12th of December I wrote
home: "The weather is frightfully hot; the ledger almost
scorches my hands as I turn over the leaves." Then
again, on the 23rd, I wrote that "the heat has risen to
105&deg;, and even 110&deg;, in the shade; yet, in consequence
of the dryness and purity of the atmosphere, I bear it
easily, and even go out to walk."</p>

<p>My favourite walk in the bush, in early summer, is
towards the summit of a range of hills on the south
of the township. I set out a little before sunset, when
the heat of the day is well over, and the evening begins
to feel deliciously cool. All is quiet; there is nothing
to be heard but the occasional note of the piping-crow,
and the chatter of a passing flock of paroquets. As I
ascend the hill, passing an abandoned quartz-mine, even
these sounds are absent, and perfect stillness prevails.
From the summit an immense prospect lies before me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Six miles away to the south, across the plain, lies the
town of Talbot; and beyond it the forest seems to
extend to the foot of the Pyrenees, standing up blue in
the distance some forty miles away. The clouds hang
over the mountain summits, and slowly the monarch
of day descends seemingly into a dark rift, leaving a
track of golden light behind him. The greeny-blue
sky above shines and glows for a few minutes longer,
and then all is suffused in a soft and mournful grey.
The change is almost sudden. The day is over, and
night has already come on. Darkness follows daylight
so suddenly that in nights when there is no moon, and
it is cloudy, one has to hasten homeward, so as not to
miss the track or run the risk of getting benighted in
the bush.</p>

<p>But, when the moon is up, the nights in Australia
are as brilliant as the days. The air is cool, the sky
cloudless, and walking in the bush is then most delightful.
The trees are gaunt and weird-like, the
branches standing in bold relief against the bright
moonlight. Yet all is so changed, the distant landscape
is so soft and lovely, that one can scarcely believe
that it is the same scene we have so often looked upon
in broad daylight. It is no exaggeration to say that
the Australian moonlight is so bright that one may
easily read a book by it of moderately-sized type.</p>

<p>But Australian summer weather has also its <i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>.
The worst of these is the hot north wind, of
which I have already described my foretaste; though
old colonists tell me that these have become much less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
intolerable, and occur much seldomer, since the interior
of the country has been settled and comparatively cultivated.
But the hot winds are still bad to bear, as
I can testify. They blow from the parched lands of
Central Australia, and bring with them clouds of dust
and insects. I should think they must resemble the
African simoom. The Melbourne people call these
burning blasts the "brick-fielders." The parching
wind makes one hot and feverish, and to fly to the
bar for cooling drinks; but there even the glasses are
hot to the touch. Your skin becomes so dry and crisp
that you feel as if it would crackle off. The temperature
rises to 120&deg;&mdash;a pretty tidy degree of heat!
There is nothing for it but to fly within doors, shut up
every cranny to keep out the hot dust, and remain
in darkness.</p>

<p>While the hot wind lasts, the air is of a heavy copper
colour. Everything looks yellow and withered. The
sun appears through the dust dull red, and no bigger
than the moon, just as it does on a foggy morning
in London. Perhaps after an hour or two of this
choking heat the hot wind, with its cloud of dust,
passes away southward, and we have a deliciously
cool evening, which we enjoy all the more contrasted
with the afternoon's discomfort. The longest time
I have known the hot wind to last was two days, but
it is usually over in a few hours. The colonials say
that these winds are even of use, by blowing the insect
tribes out to sea; and that but for them the crops
would, in summer time, be completely eaten away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Another source of discomfort is the flies in summer.
They abound everywhere. They fill the rooms, and
as you pass along the streets they rise in clouds. The
ceilings are sometimes black with them, and no food
can be left exposed for an instant without the certainty
of its being covered with them. There is one disgusting
yellow-bodied blow-fly, which drops his maggots
with extraordinary fecundity. The flies are also
a nuisance in the bush, where veils are usually worn
when driving, to prevent their annoyance. And in the
swamps there are vigorous and tormenting musquitoes,
as I have elsewhere described.</p>

<p>After the parching heat of summer, and especially
after the excessive dryness occasioned by the hot
winds, the whole face of the country becomes, as it
were, combustible, and bush-fires have at such times
burst forth apparently spontaneously, and spread with
great rapidity. The "Black Thursday" of the colony,
some fifteen years since, when fire covered many
hundreds of miles, is still remembered with horror;
but, as settlement and cultivation have extended, these
sudden outbreaks of fire have become comparatively
rare.</p>

<p>When Christmas arrives, summer is at its height.
It finds us perhaps gasping with heat, sitting in our
shirt-sleeves for coolness, and longing for the cool
evening. Yet there are few who do not contrive to
have their Christmas roast and plum-pudding, as at
home. As strawberries are then in their prime and
in great abundance, many hold strawberry picnics on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Christmas Day; while sober church-goers enjoy them
at home.</p>

<p>The abundance of fruits of all kinds affords one of
the best proofs of the geniality of the climate. First
come strawberries, followed by abundance of plums,
peaches, and apricots, and afterwards by pears and
apples in plenty. Our manager's garden at Maryborough
is a sight worth seeing in summer time.
Having a plentiful supply of water, he is able to bring
his fruit to great perfection. The plum and peach
trees seemed almost overburdened with their delicious
loads. Through the centre of the garden is a cool
green alley, shaded with a vine-covered trellis. The
bunches of fast-ripening grapes are hanging on all
sides, and promise an abundant crop.</p>

<p>Some of my pleasantest associations are connected
with the January afternoons spent in the orchards
about Majorca. One day a party of us drove out in
search of a good fruit-garden. We went over the hill
to the south, and down the long valley on the Talbot
road, raising clouds of white dust as we went; then up
another hill, from the summit of which, down by the
banks of the creek, and almost close to the foot of
Mount Greenock, we discovered the garden of which
we had come in search. We descended and entered
the garden, still covered with greenery, notwithstanding
the tremendous heat, and there found the fruit
in perfection.</p>

<p>Mount Greenock is one of the many volcanic hills
which abound in this neighbourhood. It is almost a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
perfect cone, some eight or nine hundred feet high.
"What a splendid prospect from the summit!" said one
of my companions. "Well, let us go up&mdash;there will
probably be a fine breeze on the top." "Too hot by
far," was the answer. "Not at all," said I, "the thing
is to be done." "Well," said my friend, "you may go
if you like; but if you do, and are back in three-quarters
of an hour, I'll undertake to shout fruits and
drinks for the remainder of the afternoon."</p>

<p>A noble offer! So I immediately stripped, took one
look at the steep hill above, the withered grass upon it
almost glittering in the sun, and started. I was soon
across the nearly-dry creek, and, beginning the ascent,
I went on pretty steadily until I was within about two
hundred feet of the summit, when the great heat
began to tell upon me. I stopped, looked down the
steep hill up which I had come, saw what a little
way further comparatively I had to go, and clambered
upward again. It was still a long and fatiguing pull,
mostly over loose lava stones; but at last I reached
the top, panting and out of breath. After such a
tremendous pull as that, I do not think any one will
venture to say that my lungs can be unsound.</p>

<p>I looked round at the magnificent view. It was
indeed well worth climbing the hill to see. I first
turned my eyes northward towards Majorca. There it
was, with its white streak of pipeclay above it. Beyond,
in the distance, lay Carisbrook, with the bald hill
standing out in bold relief behind it. Nearer at hand
are the mining works of several companies, with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
engine-sheds surrounded by huge piles of refuse.
Turning my eyes southward, I saw Talbot, about a mile
off, looking quite an important place, with its numerous
red-brick buildings and clusters of comfortable-looking
houses. On the west, towards Maryborough, lay a
wide extent of bush, clad in its never varying dark
green verdure. The sky was clear, blue, and cloudless;
and though the sun was in all his strength, the
light breeze that played round the top of the mount
made the air pleasant and exhilarating to breathe.</p>

<p>I shortly turned my steps down-hill, tacking and
zigzagging in the descent because of the steepness. I
was soon at the foot of the mount, across the brook,
and seated in the garden, enjoying the fresh fruit, with
an occasional draught of colonial wine.</p>

<p>Apropos of wine and grapes. It is anticipated by
those who have had the longest experience of the
climate and soil of Victoria, that it is not unlikely
before long to become one of the principal wine-growing
countries in the world. The vine grows luxuriantly,
and the fruit reaches perfection in all parts of the
colony, but more particularly in the fine district
situated along the River Murray. Most of the farmers
up country make their own wines for home use. It is
a rough, wholesome sort of claret. But when the Germans,
who are well accustomed to the culture of the
vine, give the subject their attention, a much finer
quality is produced. There are already several vineyard
associations at work, who expect before long to
export largely to England, though at present the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
greater part of the wine grown is consumed in the
colony. A friend of mine at Melbourne has planted an
extensive vineyard at Sunbury, some thirty miles north
of the city, cultivated by Swiss vignerons; and, though
I am no judge of wine, the Burgundy which I tasted at
his table was very grateful to my inexperienced palate,
and I was told that it was of very superior quality.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>After summer comes harvest, when the farmer gathers
in the produce of his year's industry, takes stock, and
counts his gains. Harvest is well over by the end of
February. When I rode out to Perry's Farm, on the
second day of March, I found the fields already cleared,
and the grain housed. All the extra hands had gone.
Only a week before, the fields had been busy with
reapers, binders, and machine-men, for whom enormous
meat pies had to be cooked and great joints of meat
roasted,&mdash;for labouring men in Australia are accustomed
to consume much larger quantities of flesh meat than
at home.</p>

<p>The scene is now perfectly quiet. The cows are
coming in to be milked, and a very fine lot they are&mdash;fifteen
or more. The great stacks of straw are shining
in the red sunlight, for the sun is getting low, though
it is still warm. We go up to the farmhouse, having
hung our horses' reins over the rail, and saunter in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
through the back door. Here no handing in of cards
is required, for we know we are sure of being made
welcome; and in Australia hospitality is boundless.
We taste the grapes, which are just ripe, and wash
them down with a glass of home-brewed mead. But
beware of that mead! Though it looks very innocent,
it is really very strong and heady.</p>

<p>The farmer then took us into his barn, and proudly
pointed with his heavy whip to the golden grain piled
up on the floor; then over his stable, to look at his
horses. There we found our own nags, which had been
taken in for a feed. Bringing them out, and mounting
again, we rode on a little further to another farm
situated on a hill-side a little higher up the valley.</p>

<p>The farmhouse here is a little gem of a dwelling,
situated in a nice shady place, in the midst of a
luxurious garden. Here, too, we dismounted and entered
the house, for we knew the host&mdash;a most genial
fellow, whose honest English face it was always a
pleasure to see: it was so full of kindness and good
humour. We took a stroll round the garden while the
sun was setting, and then turned in for a cup of good
tea, which "missus" had got ready for us.</p>

<p>One of our entertainer's greatest delights was in
talking about "old times"&mdash;though they were only a
year or two old after all,&mdash;yet "new chums" were always
ready to sit listening to his tales open-mouthed. He
had been a digger, like most of the farmers hereabout,
and he told us how he was the first to find the gold at
the great rush at Maryborough; how he saw the gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
glistening in the gravel one day that he was out in the
bush; how, for weeks, he lived quietly, but digging and
gathering gold early and late, until, having made his
little golden harvest, enough to buy and stock a farm,
he went and gave information to the commissioner
as to the find, and then what a rush of thousands of
diggers there was to the ground! how streets sprang up,
stores were opened, hotels were built, and at last Maryborough
became the great place that it is&mdash;the thriving
centre of a large mining as well as agricultural district.</p>

<p>In such old diggers' talk two hours had passed almost
before we were aware; and then we rose to go. The
horses were brought out, and we mounted and rode
cautiously home, for it was now quite dark. It was a
fine mild night, and we had plenty of time; so we
talked and laughed our way through the bush&mdash;our
voices the only sounds to be heard, except it might
be the noise of a bird rising on the wing, startled from
its perch by our merry laughter or the clatter of our
horses' hoofs on the hard ground as we trotted along.</p>

<p>Another day, I drove out with one of the neighbouring
farmers to his place on the other side of the
Deep Creek. At this late season the bush is dried
up and melancholy-looking; very different from what
it is in the lovely spring time. Now the bush seems
dead-alive, fast putting on its winter garb, while withered
stalks of grass cover the plains. We pass the neighbourhood
of a large squatter's station, the only one
about here,&mdash;the run being very large, extending for
a great distance over the plains. It consists of not less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
than 60,000 acres of purchased land and 60,000 acres
of government land, on which the squatter exercises
the usual rights of pasturage.</p>

<p>Crossing the creek by a wooden bridge, we were
shortly at my friend's farm. We heard the buzzing
noise of the threshing-machine in the adjoining fields.
There was the engine busily at work, just as at home.
Steam penetrates everywhere,&mdash;across the seas, over the
mountains, and into the bush. We soon came up to
the engine, where the men were at work. It was pretty
severe under a hot sun, amidst clouds of dust and bits
of chaff flying about from the thresher. Many of
the men wore spectacles to protect their eyes from the
glare of the sun's heat.</p>

<p>The engine was just about to stop, to allow the men
to have their midday spell of rest; and they were soon
at their meal of meat and cold tea. The farmer came
upon some of the men smoking quite unconcernedly
beside the great piles of straw; and wroth he was at
their carelessness, as well he might be, for had a fire
burst out, it would have destroyed straw, wheat, engine,
and all. The wheat seemed of excellent quality, and
the farmer was quite pleased with his crop, which is not
always the case with farmers.</p>

<p>We afterwards went over the farm buildings, which
are neat and substantial. A large stone barn has at one
end of it a kitchen attached, where the men's victuals
are cooked during harvest time; and, close at hand, is
a comfortable stone cottage for the accommodation of
the manager and his family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>After going over the farm, I had a refreshing bathe
in the creek, at a convenient place; though I have
heard that it is not unusual for bathers who get into a
muddy water-hole to be startled by a sudden sting, and
when they emerge from the water, to find half a dozen
hungry leeches hanging on to their skin. For leeches
are plentiful in Australia, and even form an article
of considerable export to England.</p>

<p>We afterwards went out to Perry's harvest dance
and supper, with which the gathering in of the crops is
usually celebrated, as at home. The wheat had by this
time all been sold and cleared out of the barn, and it
was now rigged up as a ball-room. We had a good
long spell of dancing, to the music of a violin and a
bush piano. Perhaps you don't know what a bush
piano is? It consists of a number of strings arranged
on a board, tightened up and tuned, upon which the
player beats with a padded hammer, bringing out
sounds by no means unmusical. At all events, the
bush piano served to eke out the music of our solitary
violin.</p>

<p>After the dance there was the usual bounteous
supper, with plenty to eat and drink for all; and then
our horses were brought out and we rode homeward.
It was the end of harvest, just the time of the year
when, though the days were still warm, the nights
were beginning to be cool and sharp, as they are about
the beginning of October in England. One night
there was a most splendid Aurora, one of the finest,
it is said, that had been seen, even in Australia. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
huge rose-coloured curtain seemed to be let down across
half the sky, striped with bright golden colour, shaded
off with a deeper yellow. Beneath the red curtain,
close to the horizon, was a small semicircle of bright
greenish yellow, just as if the sun were about to rise;
and bright gleams of light shot up from it far into
the sky, making the rose-coloured clouds glow again.
The brilliancy extended upwards almost to the zenith,
the stars glimmering through the darker or less bright
part of the sky. Though I have mentioned "clouds,"
there was not a cloud to be seen; the clouds I name
were really masses of brilliant light, obscuring the deep
blue beyond. I feel the utter powerlessness of words
to describe the magnificence of the scene.</p>

<p>The weather-wise people predicted a change of
weather; and sure enough a change shortly followed.
We had had no rain for weeks; but early on the
second morning after the appearance of the Aurora, I
was awakened by the noise of heavy rain falling upon
our slight iron roof. I found a tremendous storm raging
and the rain falling in masses. Our large iron tank
was completely filled in half an hour; and, overflowing,
it ran in upon our bank floor and nearly flooded us out.
We had an exciting time of it, baling out the water as
fast as it ran in; for somehow, the drain running underneath
our boarded house had got stopped. At last the
rainfall ceased and the water was got rid of, leaving
everything in a state of damp&mdash;damp stools and chairs,
damp sheets, damp clothes, damp books, damp paper,
damp everything.</p>

<h3>BUSH ANIMALS&mdash;BIRDS&mdash;SNAKES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The 'Possum</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Night's Sport in the Bush</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Musquitoes</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wattle
Birds</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Piping-Crow</span>&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Miners</span>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paroquet-hunting</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Southern Cross</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Snakes</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marsupial Animals</span>.</p>


<p>A favourite sport in Australia is 'possum-shooting.
The Australian opossum is a marsupial quadruped,
living in trees and feeding on insects, eggs, and fruits.
Its body is about twenty-five inches in length, besides
which it has a long prehensile tail, with which it clings
to the branches of the trees in which it lives. Its skin
is covered with thick fur, of a uniform smoky-black
colour, tinged with chestnut, and it is very much sought
after because of its warmth and beauty.</p>

<p>The proper time for 'possum-shooting is at night,
when the moon is nearly at her full, and one can see
about almost as well as in the daytime. Even Venus
is so bright that, on a night when the moon was absent,
I have seen her give light enough to drive by.</p>

<p>A well-trained dog is almost indispensable for scenting
the 'possums and tracking them to their tree, beneath
which he stands and gives tongue. When the dog
stands and barks, you may be sure there is the "'possum
up a gum-tree." I never had the good fortune to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
accompanied by a well-trained dog; but only by young
ones new to the sport.</p>

<p>We had, therefore, to find and sight our own game.
This is done by looking carefully along each branch,
with the tree between you and the bright moonlight;
and if there be a 'possum there, you will see a little
black furry-like ball, motionless in the fork of a limb.
On the first night that I went out 'possum-shooting with
a party of friends, we trudged a good way into the bush,
and searched the trees for a long time in vain.</p>

<p>At length the old colonial who accompanied us,
coming up to a large tree, said, "Ah! here is a likely
place;" and we began carefully to spy the branches;
"There he is," said the colonial, pointing to a limb
where he said the 'possum was. At first I could make
out nothing. But at last I spied the little round ball.
He fired, and the animal fell to the ground dead.</p>

<p>A little further on we searched again and found
another. Now it was my turn. I took steady aim at
the black object between me and the moon, and fired.
Looking through the smoke, I saw Joey hanging on to
the branch by his tail; and in half a minute more he
dropped to the ground. I found that this was one of
the ring-tailed species, the top of the tail being bare
for about two inches, and formed like a white ring.
'Possums of this sort use their tails for climbing, like
the spider-monkey of Africa. I found I could carry
my ring-tailer hanging on to my finger, even after he
was quite dead.</p>

<p>The next 'possum fell wounded from the tree, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
took to his heels, with the little dogs after him; and
they settled him after a short fight. Sometimes the
'possum, after being hit, will cling a long time to the
tree by his tail, with his body hanging down. Then the
best and lightest climber goes up to shake him down,
and he soon drops among the dogs, which are all excitement
and ready to fall upon him. Occasionally he
will give them a good run, and then the object is to
prevent him getting up another tree.</p>

<p>Proceeding on our search, we found ourselves on
some low swampy ground, where there were said to be
abundance of 'possums. But I had no sooner entered
the swamp than I was covered with musquitoes of the
most ravenous character. They rose from the ground
in thousands, and fastened on my "new chum" skin,
from which the odour of the lime-juice had not yet
departed;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and in a few minutes I was literally in torment,
and in full retreat out of the swamp. Not even
the prospect of a full bag of 'possums would tempt
me again in that direction.</p>

<p>In all, we got seven 'possums, which is considered a
very small bag. There is a practised sportsman in the
town who goes out with a well-trained dog, accompanied
by a horse and cart; and he is disappointed if he does
not bring home quite a cart-load of fur.</p>

<p>When we had got done with our sport, and resolved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
on wending our way homewards, I had not the faintest
idea where we were, or of the direction in which we
were to proceed. Of course, near the town there are
plenty of tracks, but here there were none; and there
is such a complete sameness in the bush that I wondered
that even my experienced friend should be able
to guide us back. But he had no difficulty in finding
the way, and we were soon tramping steadily along
under the bright moonlight, the straggling gum-trees
looking more gaunt and unshapely than usual,&mdash;the
dry twigs crackling under our feet; and we reached
the township long after midnight.</p>

<p>On another occasion I accompanied the Maryborough
doctor into the bush to shoot wattle birds for a pie;
but we did not succeed in getting a pieful. I have an
idea that the gay-coloured dress of a young lady who
accompanied us frightened the birds away. There
were plenty of birds about, but very few of the sort we
wanted&mdash;a bird as large as a pigeon, plump and tender
to eat. The doctor drove us in and out among the
trees, and had once nearly turned us all perforce out of
the buggy, having got his wheels locked in the stump
of a tree.</p>

<p>The speckled honey-suckers, yellow and black,
chirped and gabbled up among the trees. The leather-heads,
with their bare neck and ruffle of white feathers,
almost like so many vultures in miniature, gave out
their loud and sudden croak; then lazily flapped their
wings and flew away to the next tree. Suddenly there
is heard the single cry of the bell-bird, just like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
ringing of a glass bell; while far off in the bush you
could hear the note of the Australian magpie or piping-crow,
not unlike that of a silver flute, clear, soft, and
musical. The piping-crow is, indeed, a clever bird,
imitating with wonderful accuracy the cries of other
birds; and when tamed it is exceedingly amusing,
readily learning to whistle tunes, which it does extremely
well.</p>

<p>Another day, I went out shooting with the Presbyterian
minister, an enthusiastic taxidermist, now occupied
in making a very nice collection of Australian
birds. We had a gay time of it in the bush that day.
There were plenty of grey and black mina-birds, or
"miners," as they are called here, chattering away in
the trees in groups of four or five. They are a species
of grakle, and are lively and intelligent birds, some of
them possessing a power of imitating human speech
equal to any of the parrot tribe. They are very peculiar
looking, grey in the body, with a black dab on
the head, and a large bright yellow wattle just behind
the eye. We pass the "miners" unmolested, for the
minister tells me they are "no good" if you want eating,
whilst as specimens they are too common.</p>

<p>Then there are the tiny grey wrens, sitting about in
scores,&mdash;so small that an English wren looks monstrous
beside them. Across the sunlight, and away over a
hollow, there flies a flock of green and yellow paroquets,
screaming as they fly. The brilliant colours of
their wings flash and glitter as they come from under
the shadow of the trees. Now we stalk a solitary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
piping-crow from tree to tree; but no sooner do you
get near enough to take a pot shot at him than he
pipes his note, and is off. The only way of getting at
him is to proceed cautiously from bush to bush; but
even then, so shy a bird is he, that it is very difficult
to bag him.</p>

<p>There is a flock of great white sulphur-crested
cockatoos clustered up in a high tree. Can we get a
shot? They seem to anticipate our design, for on the
moment they rise and wheel overhead with elevated
crests, uttering their shrill hoarse cries. These are the
fellows that occasion our farmers so much trouble by
eating the freshly-sown grain.</p>

<p>Then look! on that branch are twenty or thirty
lovely little swift paroquets, with green and dark blue
wings tipped with yellow. They are climbing in and
out of the scant leafage, under and over the limbs of
the tree, hanging on by their claws; and they only
rise if they see us near enough to take a shot at them,
when they take to wing screaming, and fly away in
a flock.</p>

<p>Once, when I had gone out parrot-potting, with
another young fellow almost as green as myself, we
had very nearly got bushed. We had been following
up a flock of Blue Mountain parrots&mdash;handsome birds&mdash;of
which we wanted specimens for our collection.
After some slight success, we turned our way homewards.
The sun was just setting. Marking its position
in the heavens, we took what we thought was the
right direction. There were no tracks to guide us&mdash;no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
landmarks&mdash;nothing but bush. After walking for some
time, and looking again at the light of the sky where
the sun had gone down, we found that we had made
a circuit upon our track, and were walking exactly
in the opposite direction to our township. We hastily
retraced our steps, for we knew that it would soon be
dark, as the twilight is so short in Australia. Fortunately
for us, it was a very clear night, and as the stars
came brightly out we saw before us the Southern Cross
high up on our left, which guided us on our way. Had
it been a cloudy night, most probably we should have
had to spend it in the bush; but, thanks to the
Southern Cross and good legs, we at length, though
late, reached our township in safety.</p>

<p>There are sometimes snakes met with in the bush,
though I saw but few of them, and these are always
ready to get out of your way. The largest fellow I
saw was drawn out from under the flooring of a weather-boarded
hut on the hill-side above Majorca. I was
coming down early one morning from the school-house,
when I stopped at the hut to speak with the occupant.
It is a very tidy little place, divided into two rooms&mdash;parlour
and bedroom. The parlour was pasted all
over with cheap prints reminding one of home, mostly
taken from 'Punch' and the 'Illustrated London News.'
Photographs of old friends were also hung over the
mantel-shelf. The floor was neat and clean; the little
pot was simmering over the little fire, and all was
getting ready for breakfast. A very pleasant picture
of a thriving emigrant's home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>As I was standing outside, about to take my leave,
casting my eyes on the ground, I saw beneath the
bench close to the door a long brownish-grey thing
lying quite still. I at once saw that it was a snake,
and snatched up a billet of wood to make a blow at
him; but my friend, who had more experience in such
matters, held me back. "Just wait a moment," said
he, "and let me get hold of him." Quick as thought
he stooped down, seized firm hold of the snake by the
tail, and, whirling him rapidly round his head three
or four times, he dashed him against the boards of the
hut and let him drop, crushing the reptile's head with
his boot-heel. The snake was four feet six inches in
length, and said to be of a very poisonous sort.</p>

<p>Snakes are much more common in the less cleared
parts of the colony, and fatal snake-bites are not infrequent.
The most successful method of treatment
is that invented by Dr. Halford, of Melbourne, which
consists in injecting a solution of ammonia into a vein
dissected out and opened for the purpose. This is said
at once and almost completely to destroy the effects of
the poison. Since my return home I observe that Dr.
Halford has been publicly rewarded for his discovery.</p>

<p>Kangaroo-hunting is one of the great sports of Victoria,
but it was not my fortune to see a hunt of this sort.
There are now very few, if any, kangaroo in this immediate
neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Yet there is no lack of marsupial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
animals of the same character: the opossum is one of
these. There is also a small kind of kangaroo, called
the wallaby, which, though I have not hunted, I have
eaten. And wallaby stew is by no means a bad dish:
the flesh tastes very much like venison. Indeed, the
marsupial animals of Australia are of almost endless
variety, ranging from a very tiny animal, no bigger
than our field-mouse, to the great old-man kangaroo,
which measures between seven and eight feet from the
nose to the tip of the tail. The peculiarity of all this
class of animals, from the smallest to the largest, is
the marsupium, or pouch, in which the females carry
their immature young until they are old enough to
shift for themselves. The kangaroo is almost confined
to Australia, though several species are also to be
met with in the neighbouring islands.</p>

Mine</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gold-seeking</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Diggers' Tales of lucky Finds</span>.</p>


<p>I must now be excused if I talk a little "shop."
Though my descriptions hitherto have, for the most
part, related to up-country life, seasons, amusements,
and such like, my principal concern, while living in
Majorca, was with bank business and gold-buying.
The ordinary business of a banking office is tolerably
well known, but the business of gold-buying is a
comparatively new feature, peculiar to the gold-producing
districts, and is, therefore, worthy of a short
description.</p>

<p>The gold is found and brought to us in various
forms. The Majorca gold is generally alluvial, consisting
of coarse gold-dust and small nuggets washed
out from the gravel. There are also some quartz reef
mining companies, whose gold is bought in what we
call a retorted state. Let me explain. The quartz
containing the gold is stamped and broken up by heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
iron hammers falling upon it; and a stream of water
constantly running down into the box in which the
stampers work, the soluble dirt is washed away, while
the particles of quartz and gold are carried forward
over boards, in which, at intervals, are small ripples
containing quicksilver. The quicksilver clings to the
gold and forms an amalgam with it. This is collected,
taken out, and squeezed in bags of chamois leather,&mdash;by
which the greater part of the quicksilver is pressed
out and saved for a repetition of the process. The
residue is placed in a retort, and exposed to heat, by
which the remainder of the quicksilver is driven off by
evaporation, leaving the gold in a solid lump. There
are, however, various other processes by which the gold
is separated from the quartz.</p>

<p>Sometimes the gold is offered for sale in a very imperfectly
separated state, and then considerable judgment
is required in deciding as to its value. In alluvial
gold there is always a certain proportion of chips of
iron, which have flown from the picks used in striking
and turning up the gravel. These pieces of iron
are carefully extracted by means of a magnet. The
larger bits of gold, if there be any, are then taken out
and put to one side. The remainder is put into a
shallow tin dish, which is shaken with a peculiar turn
of the wrist, and all the sand and dirt thus turned to
the point of the dish. This is blown off; then up goes
the gold again, and you blow and blow until all the
sand is blown off. If there remain any gold with quartz
still adhering to it, the particles are put into a big iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
mortar and well beaten, and the process above described
is repeated. The gold is then ready for weighing
and buying, and there is usually no difficulty in
settling the price with English diggers, the price varying
according to the assay of the gold.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Our great difficulty is with the Chinamen, who are
very close-fisted fellows. They mostly work at sludge,
which Englishmen have already washed; and they
are found hanging on to the tailings of old workings,
washing the refuse in order to extract the gold that
had been missed. Old tailings are often thus washed
several times over, and never without finding gold to
a greater or less amount. When a party of Chinamen
think they can do better elsewhere, they may be seen
moving off, carrying their whole mining apparatus on
their backs, consisting of tubs, blankets, tin scoops, and
a small washing-cradle.</p>

<p>The Chinamen get their gold in a very rude way,
though it seems to answer their purpose. They put
the stuff to be washed on to their cradle, and by
scooping water over it and keeping the cradle going
they gradually rinse it away, the fluid running over
two or three ledges of blankets, and leaving the fine
gold remaining behind adhering to the wool. After the
process has been continued sufficiently long, the gold-dust
is collected from the blankets, and is retorted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the Chinamen themselves, and then they bring it for
sale. The retorting has usually been badly done, and
there remains a good deal of quicksilver and nitric
acid adhering to the gold. The only way of dealing
with it is to put the whole into a crucible, then make
it red hot, and keep the gold at the melting-point for
five or ten minutes.</p>

<p>As we have got no furnace of our own on the premises,
I have frequently to march up the street to
the blacksmith's shop, to put John Chinaman's gold
to the test. If John is allowed to go by himself, he
merely waits till the gold gets warm, takes it out
again, and brings it back, saying, "All light; welly
good, welly good gole; no gammon." But you should
see John when I go up to the blacksmith's myself, put
the crucible into the hottest part of the fire, and begin
to blow the bellows! When the gold begins to glow
with heat, and he knows the weight is diminishing by
the quicksilver and dirt that are flying off, he cries,
"Welly hot! too muchee fire; me losem too muchee
money!" But the thing must be done, and John
must take the choice of his dirty gold or the regular
price for it when cleaned. I have known it lose, by
this process of purifying, as much as from five to six
pennyweights in the ounce.</p>

<p>Sometimes he will bring only a few shillings' worth,
and, when the money is tendered for it, he will turn
it over in his hand, like a London cabman when his
regular fare is given him. One man, who almost invariably
brought only a very small quantity, would begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
his conversation with, "No more money now&mdash;no more
chow-chow (dinner)&mdash;no more opium!" Sometimes
matters come to a climax, and he tells us that we "too
much lie and cheatem;" on which we send him out at
the door.</p>

<p>The lower orders of Chinamen are almost invariably
suspicious that Englishmen cheat them, although some
of them are very decent fellows, and, indeed, kind and
even polite. Several times I have asked them how
they were going to spend the money for which they
had sold their gold&mdash;say five shillings; and they would
answer, ingenuously enough, "Two shillings for opium,
three shillings for chow-chow;" leaving no margin for
sundries.</p>

<p>We buy from the Chinamen as little as three shillings'
worth of gold, and from the mining companies up to
any amount. Some of the latter bring in hundreds of
pounds' worth of gold at a time. The quartz companies
bring theirs in large yellow lumps, of over 200
ounces, fresh from the retort; and the alluvial companies
generally deposit theirs in leather bags containing
their washings, until the end of the week or
fortnight, when they sell the accumulated product.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a good deal of excitement and
anxiety about gold-digging. When men get into good
gold-yielding ground, by steady work they contrive to
make fair earnings, and sometimes a good deal of
money; but they have usually to work pretty hard for
it. Of course, the most successful men are working
miners, men who understand the business; for gold-mining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
is a business, like any other. The amateur
men, who come in search of lucky finds and sudden
fortunes, rarely do any good. Nearly all the young
fellows, sons of gentlemen, who could do no good at
home and came out here during the "rushes," are still
in no better position than they were at starting. A few
of them may have done well; but the greater number
are bullock-drivers in the country, cab-drivers in Melbourne,
shepherds in the bush, or, still worse, loafers
hanging about the drinking-bars.</p>

<p>I know many men, of good family and education,
still working as common miners in this neighbourhood.
Although their life is a rough one, they themselves
think it is better than a struggling clerk's life at home;
and perhaps they are right. I know one young man,
formerly a medical student in England, digging for
weekly wages, hired by a company of miners at
2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a week; but he is not saving money. He came
out with two cousins, one of whom broke away and
pursued his profession; he is now the head of a military
hospital in India. The other cousin remained in the
colony, and is now a hanger-on about up-country
stations. There is also the son of a baronet here, who
came out in the time of the gold-fever. He has never
advanced a step, but is wood-cutting and rail-splitting
in the bush, like a poor Savoyard. Still the traces of
his education can be seen through the "jumper" shirt
and moleskin trousers, in spite of rough ways and hard
work.</p>

<p>There are many ups and downs in gold-mining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Sometimes men will work long and perseveringly, and
earn little more than their food; but, buoyed up by
hope, they determine to go on again, and at last,
perhaps, they succeed. One day two men came into
the bank with 120<i>l.</i> worth of gold, the proceeds of
four days' mining on a new claim. They had been
working for a long time without finding anything
worth their while, and at last they struck gold. The
120<i>l.</i> had to be divided amongst six men, and out of
it they had to pay towards the cost of sinking their
shaft and maintaining their three horses which worked
the "whip" for drawing up the water and dirt out of
the mine. When they brought in their gold in a little
tin billy, the men did not seem at all elated by their
good fortune. They are so accustomed to a sudden
turn of luck&mdash;good or ill, as the case may be&mdash;that the
good fortune on this occasion seemed to be taken as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>One day, the manager and I went out to see a reef
where some men had struck gold. It lay across the
bare-looking ranges at the north of the township, in
a pretty part of the bush, rather more wooded than
usual. The reef did not look a place for so much
gold to come out of. There were a couple of shafts,
small windlasses above them, and two or three heaps
of dirty-looking brown quartz and refuse. I believe
the reef is very narrow&mdash;only from eight inches to
a foot in width; the quartz yielding from eight to
twelve ounces of gold per ton. Thus, ten tons crushed
would give a value of about 400<i>l.</i> Though this may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
seem a good yield, it is small compared with richer
quartz. I have heard of one mine which gave 200
ounces, or 800<i>l.</i>, to the ton of quartz crushed, but this
was unusually rich.</p>

<p>At some of the larger claims the works are carried
on upon a large scale with the aid of complete machinery.
Let me describe one of the mines, close to
Majorca, down which I went one day to inspect the
operations. It is called the Lowe Kong Meng mine,
and was formerly worked by Chinamen, but had to
be abandoned because of the great quantity of water
encountered, as well as the accidents which constantly
happened to the machinery. The claim was then
taken up by an English company of Tributors, who
pay a percentage of the proceeds of the mine to the
proprietor, the large Chinese merchant, Mr. Lowe Kong
Meng, who resides in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In some of the shallower workings the men go down
the shaft with their feet in a noose at the end of the
rope; or, in some small and narrow shafts, by holding
on to the sides with their knees and feet. But in large
workings, such as this (which is about 150 feet deep),
we descend in a bucket, as in ordinary mines. What a
speed we go down at! We seem to shoot down into
darkness. There&mdash;bump! we are at the bottom. But
I can see nothing; I only hear the drip, drip, and
splashing of water.</p>

<p>In a few minutes my eyes get accustomed to the
darkness: then I see the dim light of a candle held by
some one not far off. "Come up here," says the guide;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and we shortly find ourselves in a somewhat open
space, more light than the actual bottom of the shaft.
We are each supplied with a dip tallow candle, by
means of which we see where we are. The two drives
branch off from this space: the main is 6 feet 3 inches
in height, broad, and splendidly timbered with stout
wood all the way along. The Chinamen did this
work.</p>

<p>Water is running everywhere. We try to walk upon
the rails on which the trucks run, to keep our feet dry.
But it is of no use, as there is more water in our way
to get through. Every now and then we slipped off
the rail and down into the water. As we got into the
narrower and lower drives I was continually coming to
grief, my head bumping against the dirty top, my hat
coming off, or my candle getting extinguished.</p>

<p>We were taken first up to the place where the water
had broken in so heavily upon the Chinamen, and in
which direction the mine could not be worked. Strong
supports of wood held up the gravel, through which
the water poured in, running down the drives of the
well underneath the shaft. What a labyrinth all these
different passages seemed to me! yet I suppose this
claim is a small one compared with many others in
the gold-mining districts.</p>

<p>Then we were shown a monkey&mdash;not the animal,
but a small upright shaft leading into a drive above,
where the wash-dirt was being got out. Should the
course of the wash-dirt, in which the gold is, go downward
below the level of the well or the drives for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
draining the mine, the shaft must then be sunk deeper
down. The monkey was rather difficult for me to
scramble up. However, by holding on, and using the
niches at the sides, I managed to mount, as usual with
the loss of my light.</p>

<p>Along the drive we went, waiting in a corner until
a truck of dirt passed by, and its contents were shot
down the monkey into the tram waiting for it below.
Now we creep up from the drive into a narrower space,
where we crawl along upon our hands and knees. We
shortly came upon four men getting out the wash-dirt,
using their picks while squatting or lying down, and in
all sorts of uncomfortable positions. The perspiration
was steaming down the men's faces as they worked,
for the heat was very great.</p>

<p>We did not stay long in that hot place, and I did
<i>not</i> take a pick and happen to strike upon a nugget, as
it is said the Duke of Edinburgh did, though I saw a
small dish of the dirt washed when we reached the top,
and it yielded a speck or two. We saw "the colour,"
as the expression is. I felt quite relieved at last to
find myself at the top of the shaft, and in the coolness
and freshness of the open air. Here the dirt raised
from the mine is put into the iron puddling-machine,
and worked round and round with water. The water
carries off the mud, the large stones are picked out,
and the gold in the bottom of the machine is
cradled off. Such was my little experience in mine-prospecting.</p>

<p>I must also tell of my still smaller experience in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
gold-seeking. One morning a little boy brought in a
nugget for sale, which he had picked up from a heap
of dirt, while he was strolling down the lead outside
the town. After a heavy washing fall of rain, it is not
unusual for small bits of gold to be exposed to sight;
and old diggers often take a ramble amongst the
mullock after rain, to make a search amongst the
heaps. A piece of gold was once brought to us for sale,
weighing about two ounces, that had been thus washed
up by a heavy shower of rain. Inspired by the success
of the little boy, I went out in the afternoon in a pair
of thick boots, and with a pair of sharp eyes, to search
for treasure! It had been raining hard for several
days, and it was a good time for making an inspection
of the old washed-out dirt-heaps. After a long search
I found only one speck of gold, of the value of about
4<i>d.</i> This I was showing with pride to a young lady
friend, who, being playfully inclined, gave my hand a
shake, and my microscopical speck was gone, the first
and last fruits of my gold-seeking.</p>

<p>Some of the tales told by the old diggers of their
luck in the early days of gold-finding are very interesting.
One of these I can relate almost in the very
words of the man himself to whom the incident
occurred; and it was only an ordinary digger's tale.</p>

<p>"My mates and I," he said, "were camped in a
gully with some forty or fifty other miners. It was
a little quiet place, a long way from any township.
We had been working some shallow ground; but as
the wash-dirt when reached only yielded about three-quarters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of a pennyweight (about 3<i>s.</i>) to the dish, we
got sick of it, left our claim, and went to take up
another not far off. About a day or two after we had
settled upon our new ground an old acquaintance of
mine looked in upon us by chance. He was hard up&mdash;very
hard up&mdash;and wanted to know whether we could
give him anything to do. 'Well, there is our old
place up there,' said I, 'it is not much good, but you
can find enough to keep body and soul together.' So
he went up to our old place, and kept himself in tucker.
A few days after he had been at work, he found that
the further down he dug in one direction the more
gold the soil yielded. At one end of the ground a
reef cropped up, shelving inwards very much. He
quickly saw that against the reef, towards which the
gold-yielding gravel lay, the ground sloping downwards
towards the bottom must be still richer. He got excited,
threw aside the gravel with his shovel, to come
at the real treasure he expected to find. Down he
went, till he reached the slope of the reef, where the
gravel lay up against it. There, in the corner of
the ground, right in the angle of the juncture, as it
were, lay the rich glistening gold, all in pure particles,
mixed with earth and pebbles. He filled his tin dish
with the precious mixture, bore it aloft, and brought
it down to our tent, where, aided by the mates, he
washed off the dirt, and obtained as the product of his
various washings about 1000 ounces of pure gold! The
diggers who were camped about in the gully being a
rough lot, we were afraid to let them know anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of the prize that had been found. So, without saying
anything, two of us, late one night, set out with the
lucky man and his fortune to the nearest township,
where he sold his gold and set out immediately for
England, where, I believe, he is now. He left us
the remainder of his dirt, which he did not think
anything of, compared with what he had got; and
three of us obtained from it the value of 600<i>l.</i>, or
200<i>l.</i> a man."</p>

<p>The same digger at another time related to us how
and when he had found his first nugget. He declared
that it was all through a dream, "I dreamt," he said,
"that I sunk a shaft down by the side of a pretty
creek, just under a gum-tree, and close to the water;
that I worked down about ten feet there, put in a drive,
and, whilst I was working, chanced to look up, and
there, sticking in the pipeclay, was a piece of gold
as big as my fist. Such was my dream. It took complete
possession of me. I could think of nothing else.
Some weeks after, I selected just such a site for a
shaft as that I had dreamt of, under a gum-tree, close
by a creek; and there, new-chum like, I put in the
drive at the wrong depth. But, one day, when I had
got quite sick at fruitlessly working in the hole, on
accidentally looking up, sure enough there was my
nugget sticking up in the pipeclay, just as I had
dreamt of it. I took out the gold, sat with it in my
hand, and thought the thing over, but couldn't make it
out at all."</p>

<p>In the times of the early rushes to the gold-fields there
was, as might be expected, a good deal of disorder and
lawlessness. When the rumour of a new gold-field
went abroad, its richness was, as usual, exaggerated in
proportion to the distance it travelled; and men of all
classes rushed from far and near to the new diggings.
Melbourne was half emptied of its labouring population;
sailors deserted their ships; shepherds left
their flocks, and stockmen their cattle; and, worst of
all, there also came pouring into Victoria the looser
part of the convict population of the adjoining colonies.
These all flocked to the last discovered field, which
was invariably reputed the richest that had yet been
discovered.</p>

<p>Money was rapidly made by some where gold was
found in any abundance; but when the soil proved comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
poor, the crowd soon dispersed in search
of other diggings. A population so suddenly drawn
together by the fierce love of gain, and containing so
large an admixture of the desperado element, could
scarcely be expected to be very orderly. Yet it is
astonishing how soon, after the first rush was over, the
camp would settle down into a state of comparative
order and peaceableness. For it was always the
interest of the majority to put down plundering and
disorder. Their first concern was for the security of
their lives, and their next for the security of the
gold they were able to scrape together.</p>

<p>When the lawless men about a camp were numerous,
and robberies became frequent, the diggers would suddenly
extemporise a police, rout out the thieves, and
drive them perforce from the camp. I may illustrate
this early state of things by what occurred at Havelock,
a place about seven miles from Majorca. The
gully there was "rushed" about nine years since, when
some twenty thousand diggers were drawn together, with
even more than the usual proportion of grog-shanty
keepers, loafers, thieves, and low men and women of
every description. In fact, the very scum of the roving
population of the colony seems to have accumulated
in the camp; and crime upon crime was committed,
until at length an affair occurred, more dreadful and
outrageous than anything that had preceded it, which
thoroughly roused the digger population, and a rising
took place, which ended in their hunting the whole of
the thieves and scoundrels into the bush.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The affair has been related to me by three of the
persons who were themselves actors in it, and it is
briefly as follows:&mdash;At the corner of one of the main
thoroughfares of the camp, composed of canvas tents
and wooden stores, there stood an extemporized restaurant,
kept by a Spaniard named Lopez. A few yards
from his place was a store occupied by a Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;,
now a storekeeper in Majorca, and a customer at our
bank. Opposite to S&mdash;&mdash;'s store stood a tent, the occupants
of which were known to be among the most lawless
ruffians in the camp. S&mdash;&mdash; had seen the men more
than once watching his store, and he had formed the
conviction that they meant at some convenient opportunity
to rob him, so he never slept without a loaded
revolver under his pillow. One night in particular he
was very anxious. The men stood about at the front
of his store near closing time, suspiciously eyeing his
premises, as he thought. So he put a bold face on,
came to the door near where they were standing, discharged
his pistol in the air&mdash;a regular custom in the
diggings at night&mdash;reloaded, entered his store, and
bolted himself in. He went to bed at about ten o'clock,
and lay awake listening, for he could not sleep. It
was not very long before he heard some person's steps
close by his hut, and a muttering of smothered voices.
The steps passed on; and then; after the lapse of
about ten minutes, he heard a shot&mdash;a scream&mdash;and
hurried footsteps running close past his hut. He lay
in bed, determined not to go out, as he feared that this
was only a <i>ruse</i> on the part of the thieves to induce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
him to open his door. But soon he heard shouts outside,
as of persons in pursuit of some one, and jumping
out of bed, he ran out half dressed and joined in the
chase.</p>

<p>Now, this is what had happened during the ten
minutes that he had lain in bed listening. The thieves
had stolen past his store, as he had heard them, and
gone forward to the restaurant kept by the Spaniard.
They looked into the bar, and through the chinks of
the wood they saw Lopez counting over the money he
had taken during the day. The bar was closed, but
the men knocked at the door for admission. Lopez
asked what they wanted; the reply was that they
wished for admission to have a drink. After some
demur, Lopez at last opened the door, and the men
entered. Nobblers were ordered, and while Lopez was
reaching for a bottle, one of the thieves, named Brooke,
made a grab at the money lying in the open drawer.
The landlord saw his hand, and instantly snatching up
a large Spanish knife which lay behind the counter, he
made a lunge at Brooke, and so fiercely did he strike
that the knife ripped up the man's abdomen. With a
yell of rage, Brooke drew his revolver, instantly shot
Lopez through the head, and he fell dead without a
groan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other thieves had fled; and now
Brooke himself, holding his wound together with his
hand, ran out of the house, through the street of tents,
across the lead, and into the bush. But the hue and
cry had been raised; the diggers bundled out of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
tents, and before the murderer had reached the cover
of the bush, already a dozen men were on his track. It
was full moon, and they could see him clearly, holding
on his way, avoiding the crab-holes, and running at a
good speed notwithstanding his fearful wound. Among
the foremost of the pursuers were a trooper and an
active little fellow who is now living in Majorca. They
got nearer and nearer to Brooke, who turned from time
to time to watch their advance. The trooper was gaining
upon him fast; but when within about fifteen yards
of him Brooke turned, took aim with his revolver, and
deliberately fired. The aim was too true: the trooper
fell dead, shot right through the heart. Brooke turned
to fly immediately he had fired his shot, but the root
of a tree behind him tripped him up, and the little
man who followed close behind the trooper was upon
him in an instant, with his knee upon his body holding
him down. Brooke managed to turn himself half
round, presented his revolver at his captor, and fired.
The cap snapped on the nipple! My friend says
he will never forget the look the wretch gave him
when his pistol missed fire. A few minutes&mdash;long,
long minutes&mdash;passed, and at length help arrived and
the murderer was secured. The number shortly increased
to a crowd of angry diggers. At first they
wished to hang Brooke at once upon the nearest tree;
but moderate counsels prevailed, and at last they agreed
to take him into Havelock and send for a doctor.</p>

<p>When the crowd got back to Havelock their fury
broke out. They determined to level the thieves'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
tents and the grog-shanties that had harboured them.
What a wild scene it must have been! Two or three
thousand men pulling down huts and tents, smashing
crockery and furniture, ripping up beds, and levelling
the roosts of infamy to the ground. When Dr. Laidman,
the doctor sent for from Maryborough, arrived
to attend the dying man, he saw a cloud of "white
things" in the air, and could not make out what they
were. They turned out to be the feathers of the
numerous feather-beds, which the diggers had torn
to pieces, that were flying about. The diggers' blood
was fairly up, and they were determined to make "a
clean job of it" before they had done. And not only
did they thoroughly root out and destroy all the
thieves' dens and low grog-shops and places of ill-fame,
but they literally hunted the owners and occupants of
them right out into the bush.</p>

<p>I must now tell you of the murderer's end. He was
taken to the rude theatre of the place, and laid down
upon the stage, with his two victims beside him&mdash;the
dead Lopez on one side and the dead trooper on the
other. When the doctor arrived, he examined Brooke,
and told him he would try to keep him alive, so that
justice might be done. And the doctor did his best.
But the Spaniard's wound had been terrible and deadly.
Brooke died in about half an hour from the time of the
doctor's arrival The murderer remained impenitent
to the last, and opened his mouth only once to utter
an oath. Such was the horrible ending of this digger's
tragedy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Cases such as this are, however, of rare occurrence.
So soon as a digging becomes established, a regular
police is employed to ensure order, and local self-government
soon follows. We had often occasion to
ride over to Maryborough, taking with us gold; but
though we were well known in the place, and our
errand might be surmised, we were never molested,
nor, indeed, entertained the slightest apprehension of
danger. It is true that in the bank we usually had a
loaded revolver lying in the drawer ready at hand, in
case it should be needed; but we had never occasion to
use it.</p>

<p>Some years ago, however, an actual attempt was
openly made to rob a bank in Collingwood, a suburb
of Melbourne, which was very gallantly resisted. The
bank stood in a well-frequented part of the town, where
people were constantly passing to and fro. One day
two men entered it during office hours. One of them
deliberately bolted the door, and the other marched
up to the counter and presented a pistol at the head of
the accountant who stood behind it. Nothing daunted,
the young man at once vaulted over the counter,
calling loudly to the manager for help, and collared
the ruffian, whose pistol went off as he went down.
The manager rushed out from his room, and tackled the
other fellow. Both the robbers were strong, powerful
men, but they fought without the courage of honesty.
The struggle was long and desperate, until at last
assistance came, and both were secured. A presentation
of plate was made to the two officials who had so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
courageously done their duty, and they are still in the
service of the same bank.</p>

<p>In direct contrast to this case, I may mention a rather
mysterious circumstance which occurred at an up-country
bank, situated in a quartz-mining district. I must first
explain that the bank building is situated in a street,
with houses on both sides, and that any noise in it
would readily be heard by the neighbours. One young
fellow only was in charge of the place. The manager
of a neighbouring branch called weekly for the surplus
cash and the gold bought during the week. The
youth in charge suddenly reported one day that he
had been "stuck up," as the colonial phrase is for
being robbed. He said that one night, as he was going
into the bank, where he slept&mdash;in fact just as he was
putting the key into the lock&mdash;a man came up to him,
and, clapping a pistol to his head, demanded the key of
the safe. He gave it him, showed him where the
gold and notes were kept, and, in fact, enabled the
robber to make up a decent "swag." The man, whoever
he was, got away with all the money. The bank
thought it their duty to proceed against the clerk
himself for appropriating the money. But the proof
was insufficient, and the verdict brought in was "Not
guilty."</p>

<p>We were one day somewhat alarmed at Majorca by
a letter received from our manager at Maryborough,
informing us that a great many bad characters were
known to be abroad and at work&mdash;and cautioning us
to be particularly upon our guard. We were directed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to discharge our firearms frequently and keep them
in good order, so that in case of need they should not
miss fire. We were also to give due notice when we
required notes from Maryborough, so that the messenger
appointed to bring them over should be accompanied
by a complete escort, <i>i.e.</i>, a mounted trooper.
All this was very alarming, and we prepared for events
accordingly.</p>

<p>A few nights after, as we were sitting under the
manse verandah, we heard a loud cry of "Stop thief!"
The robbers, then, were already in the township! We
jumped up at once, looked round the corner of the
house, and saw two men running off as fast as they
could, followed at some distance by another man
shouting frantically, "Stop thief!" We immediately
started in pursuit of the supposed thieves. We soon
came up with the man who had been robbed, and
whom we found swearing in a most dreadful way.
This we were very much astonished at, as we recognised
in him one of the most pious Wesleyans in the
township. But we soon shot ahead of him, and gradually
came up with the thieves, whom we at first supposed
to be Chinamen. As we were close upon them,
they suddenly stopped, turned round, and burst out
laughing! Surely there must be some mistake! We
recognised in the "thieves" the son of the old gentleman
whom we had just passed, with one of his companions,
who had pretended to steal his fowls, as
Chinamen are apt to do: whereas they had really
carried off nothing at all. In short, we, as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
our respected Wesleyan friend, felt ourselves completely
"sold."</p>

<p>The only attempt at dishonesty practised upon our
branch which I can recollect while at Majorca was
one of fraud and not of force. We had just been
placed in telegraphic communication with the other
towns in the colony. The opening of the telegraph
was celebrated, as usual, by the Town Council "shouting"
champagne. Some time before, a working-man,
who had some money deposited with us, called in a
fluster to say his receipts had been stolen. This was
noted. Now came a telegram from Ballarat, saying
that a receipt of our branch had been presented for
payment, and asking if it was correct. We answered
sharp, ordering the man to be detained. He was
accordingly taken into custody, handed over to the
police, and remanded to Newstead, where the receipt
had been stolen. Newstead is a long way from
Majorca, but our manager drove over with a pair of
horses to give his evidence. It turned out that our
customer's coat, containing the receipt, had been stolen
while he was at his work. The thief was identified as
having been seen hanging about the place; and the
result was that he was committed, tried, and duly
convicted. So you see that we are pretty smart out
here, and not a long way behind the old country
after all.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting visits to places that I made
while staying at Majorca was to Ballarat, the mining
capital of the colony, sometimes called here the Victorian
Manchester. The time of my visit was not the
most propitious, for it was shortly after a heavy fall
of rain, which had left the roads in a very bad state.
But I will describe my journey.</p>

<p>Three of us hired a one-horse buggy to take us on
to Clunes, which lay in our way. The load was rather
too much for the horse, but we took turn and turn
about at walking, and made it as light for the animal
as possible. At Clunes I parted with my companions,
who determined to take the buggy on to Ballarat. I
thought it preferable to wait for the afternoon coach;
and after being hospitably entertained at dinner by
the manager of our Branch Bank at Clunes, I took my
place in the coach for Ballarat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>We had not gone more than about a mile when the
metalled road ended, and the Slough of Despond began,&mdash;the
road so called, though it was little more than a
deep mud-track, winding up a steepish ascent. All
the passengers got out and walked up the hill. In the
distance we saw a buggy in difficulties. I had already
apprehended the fate of my mates who had gone on
before me, and avoided sharing it by taking my place
in the coach. But we were in little better straits ourselves.
When we got up to the buggy, we found it
fairly stuck in the mud, in one of the worst parts of
the road, with a trace broken. I got under the rails
of the paddock in which the coach passengers were
walking&mdash;for it was impossible to walk in the road&mdash;and
crossed over to where my former mates were stuck.
They were out in the deep mud, almost knee-deep,
trying to mend the broken trace. Altogether they
looked in a very sorry plight.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill we again mounted the coach,
and got on very well for about three miles, until we
came to another very bad piece of road. Here we
diverged from it altogether, and proceeded into an
adjoining field, so as to drive alongside the road, and
join it a little further on. The ground looked to me
very soft, and so it was. For we had not gone far
when the coach gave a plunge, and the wheels sank
axle-deep in a crab-hole. All hands had now to set
to work to help the coach out of the mud; while the
driver urged his horses with cries and cracks of his
long whip. But it was of no use. The two wheelers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
were fairly exhausted, and their struggling only sent
them deeper into the mud. The horses were then
unharnessed, and the three strongest were yoked in a
line, so as to give the foremost of them a better foot-hold.
But it was still of no use. It was not until the
mud round the wheels had been all dug out, and the
passengers lifted the hind wheels and the coach bodily
up, that the horses were at last able to extricate the
vehicle. By this time we were all in a sad state of
dirt and wet, for the rain had begun to fall quite
steadily.</p>

<p>Shortly after, we reached the half-way house and
changed horses. We now rattled along at a pretty
good pace. But every now and then the driver would
shout, "Look out inside!" and there would be a sudden
roll, followed by a jerk and pitch combined, and you
would be thrown over upon your opposite neighbour,
or he upon you. At last, after a rather uncomfortable
journey, we reached the outskirts of a large town, and
in a few minutes more we found ourselves safely
jolted into Ballarat.</p>

<p>I am not at all up in the statistics of the colony,
and cannot tell the population or the number of inhabited
houses in Ballarat.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But it is an immense
place, second in importance in the colony only to Melbourne.
Big though it be, like most of these up-country
towns, Ballarat originated in a rush. It was
only in September, 1851, that a blacksmith at Buningong,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
named Hiscocks, who had long been searching
for gold, traced a mountain-torrent back into the hills
towards the north, and came upon the rich lode which
soon became known as the "Ballarat Diggings." When
the rumour of the discovery got abroad, there was a
great rush of people to the place, accompanied by the
usual disorders; but they gradually settled down, and
Ballarat was founded. The whole soil of the place
was found to contain more or less gold. It was
gathered in the ranges, on the flats, in the water-courses,
and especially in the small veins of blue clay,
lying almost above the so-called "pipeclay." The
gold was to all appearance quite pure, and was found
in rolled or water-course irregular lumps of various
sizes, from a quarter or half an ounce in weight, sometimes
incorporated with round pebbles of quartz, which
appeared to have formed the original matrix.</p>

<p>The digging was at first for the most part alluvial,
but when skilled miners arrived from England, operations
were begun on a much larger scale, until now it
is conducted upon a regular system, by means of costly
machinery and highly-organised labour. To give an
idea of the extensive character of the operations, I
may mention that one company, the Band of Hope, has
erected machinery of the value of 70,000<i>l.</i> The main
shaft, from which the various workings branch out, is
420 feet deep; and 350 men are employed in and about
the mine. It may also be mentioned that the deeper
the workings have gone, the richer has been the yield
of gold. This one company has, in a comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
short time, raised gold worth over half a million sterling;
the quantity produced by the Ballarat mines,
since the discovery of gold in September, 1851, to the
end of 1866, having been worth about one hundred and
thirty millions sterling.</p>

<p>The morning after my arrival in Ballarat I proceeded
to survey the town, I was certainly surprised
at the fine streets, the large buildings, and the number
of people walking along the broad pathways. Perhaps
my surprise was magnified by the circumstance that
nearly fifteen months had passed since I had been in a
large town; and, after Majorca, Ballarat seemed to
me like a capital. After wandering about the streets
for half an hour, I looked into the Court-house, where
an uninteresting case of drunkenness was being
heard. I next went into the adjoining large building,
which I found to be the Public Library. The commodious
reading-room was amply supplied with books,
magazines, and newspapers; and here I amused myself
for an hour in reading a new book. Over the mantel-piece
of the large room hangs an oil painting of Prince
Alfred, representing him and his "mates" after the
visit they had made to one of the Ballarat mines.
This provision of excellent reading-rooms&mdash;free and
open to all&mdash;seems to me an admirable feature of the
Victorian towns. They are the best sort of supplement
to the common day-schools; and furnish a salutary
refuge for all sober-minded men, from the temptations
of the grog-shops. But besides the Public Library,
there is also the Mechanics' Institute, in Sturt Street;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a fine building, provided also with a large library, and
all the latest English newspapers, free to strangers.</p>

<p>The features of the town that most struck me in
the course of the day were these. First, Sturt Street:
a fine, broad street, at least three chains wide. On each
side are large handsome shops, and along the middle
of the road runs a broad strip of garden, with large
trees and well-kept beds of flowers. Sturt Street is on
an incline; and at the top of it runs Ledyard Street,
at right angles, also a fine broad street. It contains
the principal banks, of which I counted nine, all handsome
stone buildings, the London Chartered, built on
a foundation of blue-stone, being perhaps the finest of
them in an architectural point of view. Close to it is
the famous "Corner." What the Bourse is in Paris,
Wall Street in New York, and the Exchange in London&mdash;that
is the "Corner" at Ballarat. Under the verandah
of the Unicorn Hotel, and close to the Exchange Buildings,
there is a continual swarm of speculators, managers
of companies, and mining men, standing about in
groups, very like so many circles of betting-men on
a race-course. Here all the mining swindles originate.
Specimens of gold-bearing quartz are shown, shares are
bought and sold, new schemes are ventilated, and old
ones revived. Many fortunes have been lost and won
on that bit of pavement.</p>

<p>One man is reckoned as good as another in Ballarat.
Even the cad of a baker's boy has the chance of making
"a pile," while the swell broker, who dabbles in mines
and reefs, may be beggared in a few days. As one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the many instances of men growing suddenly rich
by speculation here, I may mention the following. A
short time since, a cobbler at Ballarat had a present
made to him of twenty scrip in a company that was
looking so bad that the shares had become unsaleable.
The cobbler knew nothing of the mine, but he held the
scrip. Not only so, but he bought more at a shilling
or two apiece, and he went on accumulating them,
until at the end of the year he had scraped together
some two or three hundred. At length he heard that
gold had been struck. He went to a bank, deposited his
scrip certificates, and raised upon them all the money
he could borrow. He bought more shares. They
trebled in value. He held on. They trebled again. At
last, when the gold was being got almost by the bucket,
and a great mania for the shares had set in, the cobbler
sold out at 250<i>l.</i> a share, and found himself a rich man.
The mine was, I think, the Sir William Don, one of
the most successful in Ballarat, now yielding a dividend
of about 2<i>l.</i> per share per month, or a return of about
500 per cent. on the paid-up capital.</p>

<p>But to return to my description of Ballarat. The
town lies in a valley between two slopes, spreading
up on both sides and over the summits. Each summit
is surmounted by a lofty tower, built by the Eastern
and Western Fire Brigades. These towers command a
view of the whole place, and are continually occupied
by watchmen, who immediately give the alarm on the
outbreak of fire. The people here say that the Ballarat
Fire Brigade is the smartest in the southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
hemisphere; though the engines are all manned by
volunteers. And a fire must be a serious matter in
Ballarat, where so many of the buildings&mdash;stores as
well as dwellings&mdash;are built entirely of wood. Many
of the streets are even paved with wood.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I ascended the western hill, from
which I obtained a fine bird's-eye view of the town.
The large, broad streets, at right angles to each other,
looked well laid out, neat, and clean looking. What
seemed strangest of all was the lazy puffing of the
engines over the claims, throwing out their white jets
of steam. But for the width of the streets, and the
cleanness of the place, one might almost have taken
Ballarat for a manufacturing town in Yorkshire, though
they have no flower gardens along the middle of their
streets!</p>

<p>In the evening I went to the opera&mdash;for Ballarat
has an opera! The piece was 'Faust,' and was performed
by Lyster and Smith's company from Melbourne.
The performers did their best, but I cannot
say they are very strong in opera yet at the Antipodes.</p>

<p>After thoroughly doing Ballarat, I set out on my
return to Majorca. There was the same jolting as
before, but this time the coach did not stick in the
mud. On reaching Clunes, I resolved to walk straight
to Majorca across the plain, instead of going the
roundabout way by the road. But the straightest route
is not always the shortest, as my experience on this
occasion proved. I had scarcely got fairly into the
plain before I found myself in the midst of a succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of crab-holes. These are irregular depressions, about a
yard or so apart, formed by the washing up of the
soil by eddies during floods, and now the holes were
all full of water. It was a difficult and tedious process
to work one's way through amongst them, for they
seemed to dovetail into one another, and often I had
to make a considerable d&eacute;tour to get round the worst of
them. This crab-holey ground continued for about four
miles, after which I struck into the bush, making for
the ranges, and keeping Mount Greenock and Mount
Glasgow before me as landmarks. Not being a good
bushman, I suspect I went several miles out of my
way. However, by dint of steady walking, I contrived
to do the sixteen miles in about four hours; but
if I have ever occasion to walk from Clunes again, I
will take care to take the roundabout road, and not
to make the journey <i>en zigzag</i> round crab-holes and
through the bush.</p>

<p>Among the other places about here that I have
visited were Talbot, about seven miles distant, and
Avoca, about twenty. One of the occasions of my going
to Talbot was to attend a ball given there, and another
to attend a great f&ecirc;te for the benefit of the Amherst
Hospital. Talbot gives its name to the county, though
by no means the largest town in it. The town is very
neat and tidy, and contains some good stone and brick
buildings. It consists of one principal street, with
several little offshoots.</p>

<p>The ball was very like a ball at home, though a
little more mixed. The young ladies were some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
them very pretty, and nicely dressed&mdash;some in dresses
"direct from London"&mdash;while a few of the elder ladies
were gorgeous but incongruous. One old lady, in a
juvenile dress, wore an enormous gold brooch, large
enough to contain the portraits of several families. I
was astonished to learn the great distances that some of
the ladies and gentlemen had come to be present at
the ball. Some had driven through the bush twenty
and even thirty miles; but distance is thought nothing
of here, especially when there is a chance of "meeting
company." The ball was given in the Odd Fellows'
Hall, a large square room. One end of it was partitioned
off as a supper-room, and on the partition
was sewn up in large letters this couplet from 'Childe
Harold:'&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To chase the glowing hours with flying feet."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And, to speak the truth, the young ladies, as well as
the young gentlemen present, did ample justice to the
text. The dancing continued until daybreak, and
we drove back to Majorca as the sun was rising; but
remember it was summer time, in November, when the
sun rises very early.</p>

<p>One little event arose out of this ball which may
serve to illustrate the comparative freeness of up-country
manners. A nice young lady, with whom I
danced, asked me if I would not like to be very great
friends with her. "Oh, yes! certainly." And great
friends we became at once. Perhaps she took pity
on the stranger boy so far from home. She asked if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I was fond of riding. "Very fond." "Then I will
come over to Majorca, and call upon you, and we shall
have a ride in the bush together." And I was to be
sure and have some sweets ready for her, as she was
very fond of them. I took this to be merely a little
ball-room chaff; but judge my surprise when, next
afternoon, the young lady rode up to the bank door
and called on me to fulfil my promise,&mdash;which I did,
lollipops and all.</p>

<p>A great event in Talbot is the Annual F&ecirc;te, held
on the Prince of Wales's birthday, which is observed
as a public holiday in Victoria. The f&ecirc;te this year
was held in aid of the funds of the Amherst Hospital, a
valuable local institution. At this affair the whole
population of the neighbourhood turned out. It began
at midday with a grand procession through the town.
Let me endeavour to give you an idea of the pageant.
First came the well-mounted Clunes Lancers, in their
light blue and white uniforms, 150 strong, blue and
white pennons fluttering from their long lances. Then
came lines of members of Friendly Societies, in gay
scarfs, accompanied by banners. Then a good band
of music. The Talbot 42nd Sectional Lancers next
turn the corner of the street, gorgeous in scarlet and
white. Then comes something comic&mdash;a Welsh lady
and gentleman riding a pony barebacked. These are
followed by an Irish couple, also mounted. Then
comes a Highlandman, in a vehicle such as the Highlands
never saw, discoursing music from his bagpipes.
A large open boat follows, mounted on a car;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
it is filled with sailor-boys in blue and white. This
boat is a model of the 'Cerberus,' the turret-ship
that Mr. Reed is building in England for the defence
of Port Phillip. A genuine old salt, with long white
hair, plays the part of admiral. In cocked hat, blue
admiral's coat, and white ducks, he waves his sword
frantically, and gives the word of command to repel
boarders; all the while two little cannons in the
model are being constantly fired, reloaded, and fired
again. This noisy exhibition having passed, a trophy
representing the Australian chase appears. A huntsman,
dressed in green, blowing his horn, stands amidst
some bushes, holding a handsome leash of hounds;
dead kangaroos and other Australian animals lie around
him. Then follow more lancers. After this comes a
huge car, two stories high, with all sorts of odd characters
in it: a clown, with his "Here we are again!"
playing pranks on two sedate-looking Chinamen; a
little fairy boy or girl, flirting with a magician; dragons
snapping; strange birds screeching; three bears, one
playing a violin, but the tune it plays is drowned by
the hubbub of noise and bands. A lady, of the time
of Elizabeth, gorgeous in ruffles, follows on horseback.
Then knights in armour, one of them with a stuffed
'possum snarling on the top of his helmet. Another
band. Then the solemn brethren of the Order of
Druids, in white gowns, bald heads, and grey beards.
A company of sweeps comes next, attended by an
active Jack-in-the-Green. Now an Indian doctor
appears, smoking a long pipe in his chariot, drawn by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a Brahmin bull. Another band, and then the rear is
brought up by more cavalry. There were seven bands&mdash;good
ones, too&mdash;in the procession, which took full
twenty minutes to pass the hotel, on the balcony of
which I stood. I have seen the London Lord Mayor's
Show, but must confess the Talbot procession beats it
hollow.</p>

<p>After the procession, we all adjourned to the race-course,
where the collection for the hospital was to be
made. The admission was eighteen-pence; a good sum
for working people to give, yet everybody was there.
There was an amateur Richardson's show, a magician's
tent, Cheap John's merry-go-rounds, and all sorts of
amusements to be had by paying for them; and, above
all, there was the bazaar, presided over by the ladies
of Talbot, who succeeded in selling a large quantity of
useless things at the usual exorbitant prices. There
was also a large dancing-platform roofed with canvas,
which was very well frequented. Most popular of all,
perhaps, were the refreshment-bars, where the publicans
gave the liquor free, but charged the usual prices
for the good of the hospital fund; and the teetotallers,
not to be outdone, managed a very comfortable tea-room.
In short, all the usual expedients for raising
money were cleverly resorted to, and the result was
that between 1400<i>l.</i> and 1500<i>l.</i> was added to the funds
of the hospital, about 500<i>l.</i> of which was taken at the
ladies' bazaar. Altogether, there were not less than
5000 people on the ground, though I believe the newspapers
gave a considerably higher number.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>The Avoca races were not very different from races
in England. Every town hereabouts has its races, even
Majorca. The Carrisbrook race-course, about four miles
from our town, is considered second to none in the
colony. Avoca, however, is a bigger place, and the
races there draw a much larger crowd. We drove
the twenty miles thither by road and bush-track. The
ground was perfectly dry, for there had been no rain
for some time; and, as the wind was in our faces, it
drove the clouds of dust behind us. I found the town
itself large and well-built. What particularly struck
me was the enormous width of the main street,&mdash;at least
three chains wide. The houses on either side of the
road were so remote from each other that they might
have belonged to different townships. I was told that
the reason of this great width of street was, that the
Government had reserved this broad space of ground,
the main street of Avoca forming part of the road to
Adelaide, which may at some future time become a
great and crowded highway. One of the finest buildings
in the town is a handsome hotel, built of stone
and brick, provided with a ball-room, billiard-rooms,
and such like. It is altogether the finest up-country
place of the kind that I have seen. Here we put up,
and join the crowd of loungers under the verandah.
Young swells got up in high summer costume&mdash;cutaway
coats, white hats, and blue net veils&mdash;just as at
Epsom on the Derby Day. There are also others,
heavy-looking colonials, who have come out evidently
to make a day of it, and are already freely imbibing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
cold brandy and water. Traps and cars are passing up
and down the street, in quest of passengers for the
race-course, about two miles from the town.</p>

<p>There we find the same sort of entertainments provided
for the public as on like occasions at home. The
course is about a mile and a half in extent, with the
ground well cleared. There is the saddling paddock,
in which the "knowing ones" take great interest; and
there are the usual booths for the sale of refreshments,
and especially of drink. In front of the Grand Stand
the betting-men from Melbourne are pointed out to
me,&mdash;a sharp, rough-looking set they are, dressed in
Tweed suits and flash ties, wearing diamond rings.
One of them, a blear-eyed, tall, strong man, with bushy
brown whiskers, bawling out his "two to one" on such
and such a horse&mdash;an ugly-looking customer&mdash;was described
to me as "the <i>second</i> biggest blackguard in
Victoria; give him a wide berth." Another of the
betting-men was pointed out to me as having been a
guard on the South-Eastern Railway some ten years
ago. I need not describe the races: they were like
most others. There were flat races and hurdle races.
Six horses ran for the District Plate. Four of them
came in to the winning-post, running neck and neck.
The race was won by only a head.</p>

<p>My friend remained on the course until it was too
late to return to Majorca that night. As the moon did
not rise until towards morning, we were under the
necessity of waiting until then, otherwise we might get
benighted in the bush. We tried to find a bed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the hotel, but in vain. All the beds and sofas in
Avoca were occupied. Even the billiard tables were
engaged for the night.</p>

<p>We set out on our return journey to Majorca just
as the moon was rising. She was only in her second
quarter, and did not yet give light enough to enable
us to see the road very clearly, so that we went very
cautiously at first. While my companion drove, I
snatched the opportunity for a sleep. I nodded and
dozed from time to time, wakening up suddenly to find
a large bright star blinking before my eyes. The star
sank lower and lower towards the horizon. The green-gold
rays of the morning sun rose up to meet it. The
star hovered between the pale growing light below
and the dark blue sky above. Then it melted away
in the glow of sunrise. The half-moon still cast our
shadow on the dusty track. But not for long. The
zone of yellow light in the east grows rapidly larger
and brighter. The brilliant edge of the god of day
tips the horizon; a burst of light follows; and now the
morning sun, day's harbinger, "comes dancing up the
east." The summits of the trees far away in the silent
bush are bathed in gold. The near trees, that looked
so weird-like in the moon's half light, are now decked
in green. The chill of the night has departed. It is
already broad day. By the time we reach Amherst,
eight miles from Majorca, we are glad to shade ourselves
from the blazing sun. In an hour more we
reach our destination, and after breakfast and a bath,
are ready to begin the day's duties.</p>

Victoria</span>.</p>


<p>The reader will observe, from what I have above written,
that life in Victoria is very much like life in England.
There are the same people, the same callings, the same
pleasures and pursuits, and, as some would say, the
same follies and vices. There are the same religious
bodies, the same political movements, the same social
agencies&mdash;Teetotal Societies, Mechanics' Institutes,
Friendly Societies, and such like. Indeed, Victoria is
only another England, with a difference, at the Antipodes.
The character, the habits of life, and tone of
thought of the people, are essentially English.</p>

<p>You have only to see the interest with which the
arrival of every mail from England is watched, to
recognise the strength of the tie that continues to unite
the people of the colony with those of the Old Country.
A flag is hoisted over the Melbourne Post Office to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
announce its coming, and soon the news is flashed by
telegraph all over the colony. Every local post-office
is eagerly besieged by the expecters of letters and
newspapers. Speaking for myself, my most exciting
day in the month was that on which my home letters
arrived; and I wrote at intervals all through the month
against the departure of the outgoing mail.</p>

<p>The excitement throughout the colony became intense
when the news arrived from England of the defeat of
the French before Metz. The first news came by the
'Point de Galle,' and then, six days later, intelligence
was received <i>vi&acirc;</i> San Francisco, of the disaster at
Sedan. Crowds besieged the office of the local paper
at Talbot when the mail was telegraphed; and the
doors had to be shut to keep them out until the telegram
could be set up in type and struck off. At
first the news was not believed, it was so extraordinary
and unexpected; but the Germans in the town accepted
it at once as true, and began their rejoicings forthwith.
The Irish at Talbot were also very much excited, and
wished to have a fight, but they did not exactly know
with whom.</p>

<p>There are considerable numbers of Germans settled
throughout the colony, and they are a very useful and
industrious class of settlers. They are for the most
part sober and hard-working men. I must also add
that they minister in no small degree to the public
amusement. At Maryborough they give very good
concerts. Here, the only band in the town is furnished
by the German settlers, and being a very good one, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
is in request on all public occasions. The greater
number of the Germans live at MacCullum's Creek,
about a mile distant, where they have recently opened
a Verein or Club, celebrating the event, as usual, by a
dance. It was a very gay affair. The frantic Deutschers
and their Fraus danced like mad things&mdash;Tyrolese
waltzes and old-fashioned quadrilles. There was a great
deal of singing in praise of Vaterland and Freundschaft,
with no end of "Hochs!" They kept it up, I was told,
until broad daylight, dispersing about eight o'clock in
the morning.</p>

<p>The Germans also give an annual picnic, which is a
great event in the place. There is a procession in the
morning, headed by their band and the German tri-colour
flag. In the afternoon there are sports; and in
the evening continuous dancing in a large marquee.
One of the chief sports of the afternoon is "Shooting
at the Eagle" with a cross-bow, and trying to knock off
the crown or sceptre from the effigy of a bird, crowned
with an eagle and holding a sceptre, stuck up on the
top of a high pole. The crown or the sceptre represents
a high prize, and each feather struck off represents
a prize of some value or other.</p>

<p>The French have only one representative in the
town. As I soon got to know everybody in the place,
dropping in upon them in their houses, and chatting
with them about the last news from home, I also made
the acquaintance of the Frenchman. He had last come
from Buenos Ayres, accompanied by Madame. Of course
the news about the defeat of the French army was all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
false&mdash;merely a vile <i>canard</i>. We shall soon know all.
I confess I like this French couple very much. Their
little house is always so trim and neat. Fresh-plucked
flowers are usually set out on the mantel-piece, on the
arrangement and decoration of which Madame evidently
prides herself. Good taste is so cheap and so pleasant
a thing, that I wish it were possible for these French
people to inoculate their neighbours with a little of it.
But rough plenty seems to be sufficient for the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>I must tell you of a few more of the doings of the
place, to show how very much life here resembles life
in England. The place is of course newer, the aggregation
of society is more recent, life is more rough
and ready, more free and easy, and that is nearly all
the difference. The people have brought with them
from the old country their habits of industry, their
taste for holidays, their religious spirit, their desire for
education, their love of home life.</p>

<p>Public Teas are an institution in Majorca, as at home.
There being but little provision for the maintenance of
religious worship, there is a constant whipping up for
money; and tea-meetings are usually resorted to for
the purpose of stimulating the flagging energies of the
people. Speakers from a distance are advertised, provisions
and hot water are provided in abundance; and
after a gorge of tea and buns, speeches are fired off,
and the hat goes round.</p>

<p>We had a great disappointment on one occasion,
when the Archdeacon of Castlemaine was advertised to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
preach a sermon in aid of our church fund, and preside
at the subsequent tea-meeting. Posters were stuck up;
great preparatory arrangements were made; but the
Archdeacon did not come. Some hitch must have
occurred. But we had our tea nevertheless.</p>

<p>The Ranters also are great at tea-meetings, but still
greater at revival meetings. Matthew Burnett, "the
great Yorkshire evangelist," came to our town to rouse
us from our apathy, and he certainly contrived to work
up many people, especially women, to a high pitch of
excitement. The meetings being held in the evenings,
and continued far into the nights, the howling, shouting,
and groaning were by no means agreeable noises
to such sinners in their immediate neighbourhood as
slept lightly,&mdash;of whom I was one.</p>

<p>Burnett was at the same time the great star of the
Teetotallers, who held him in much esteem. He was
a man of a rough sort of eloquence, probably the best
suited for the sort of people whom he came to address
and sought to reclaim; for fine tools are useless for
doing rough work. Another very good speaker at their
meetings was known as Yankee Bill, whose homely
appeals were often very striking, and even affecting in
a degree. At intervals they sang hymns, and sang
them very well. They thus cultivated some taste for
music. They also kept people for the time being out
of their favourite "publics." Like many teetotallers,
however, they were very intolerant of non-teetotallers.
Some even went so far as to say that one must be a
teetotaller to get to heaven. Yet, notwithstanding all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
their exaggerations, the teetotallers do much good;
and their rough appeals often penetrate hearts and
heads that would be impervious to gentler and finer
influences.</p>

<p>Let me not forget to mention the public entertainments
got up for the benefit of the common school
of the town. The existing schools being found too
small for the large number of children who attend, it
was proposed to erect another wing for the purposes
of an infant school. With this object, active efforts
were made to raise subscriptions; the understanding
being that the Government gives a pound for every
pound collected in the district.</p>

<p>The difficulties in managing these common schools
seem to be considerable, where members of different
religious persuasions sit on the Managing Committee.
At Majorca the principal difficulty seemed to be with
the Roman Catholics; and it was said that their priest
had threatened to refuse absolution to such parents as
allowed their children to attend the common school.
Whatever truth there might be in this story, it is
certain that about thirty-six children <i>were</i> withdrawn,
and instead of continuing to receive the elements of a
good education, they were entrusted to the care of an
old man quite incompetent for the office, but who was
of the right faith.</p>

<p>I was enlisted as a collector for the school fund, and
went round soliciting subscriptions; but I found it
up-hill work. My district lay in the suburbs, and I
was by no means successful. A good many of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
I called upon were Ranters; and I suspect that the
last sensation preacher had carried off what otherwise
might have fallen to my share. I was tolerably successful
with the diggers working at their claims. At
least they always gave me a civil answer. One of
them said, "Well, if our washing turns out well on
Saturday, you shall have five shillings." And the
washing must have turned out well, for on Saturday
evening the digger honestly brought me the sum he
had named.</p>

<p>Further to help the fund, a f&ecirc;te was held in the
open air, and an entertainment was given by amateurs
in the Prince of Wales's Theatre,&mdash;for our little town
also boasts of its theatre. The f&ecirc;te was held on Easter
Monday, which was kept as a holiday; and it commenced
with a grand procession of Odd Fellows,
Foresters, German Verein, Rechabites, and other
clubs, all in their Sunday clothes, and many of them
wearing very gorgeous scarfs. The German band
headed the procession, which proceeded towards the
paddock at MacCullum's Creek used on such festive
occasions. There all the contrivances usually adopted
for extracting money from the pockets of the visitors
were in full operation. There was a bazaar, in which
all manner of useless things were offered for sale;
together with raffles, bowls, croquet, dancing, shooting
at the eagle, tilting at the ring, and all sorts of
sports; a small sum being paid on entry. I took up
with a forlorn Aunt Sally, standing idle without customers,
and by dint of sedulous efforts, contrived to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
gather about a pound in an hour and a half. All
did their best. And thus a pleasant day was spent,
and a good round sum of money was collected for the
fund.</p>

<p>The grand miscellaneous entertainment was also a
complete success. The theatre was filled with a highly-respectable
audience, including many gaily-dressed
ladies, and all the belles of Majorca and the neighbourhood.
Indeed I wondered where they could all
come from. The performances excited the greater
interest, as the whole of them were by amateurs, well
known in the place. The songs went off well; and
several of them were encored. After the concert, the
seats were cleared away, and the entertainment wound
up with the usual dance. And thus did we each
endeavour to do our share of pleasant labour for the
benefit of the common school.</p>

<p>The reading-room of the Mechanics' Institute is
always a source of entertainment when nothing else
offers. The room is small but convenient, and it
contains a fair collection of books. The Telegraph
Office, the Post Office, Council Chamber, and Mechanics'
Institute, all occupy one building,&mdash;not a very
extensive one,&mdash;being only a one-storied wooden erection.
One of the chief attractions of the reading-room
is a collection of Colonial papers, with 'Punch,'
'The Illustrated News,' and the 'Irish Nation.' On
Saturday nights, when the diggers wash up and come
into town, the room is always well filled with readers.
The members of the Committee are also very active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
in getting up entertainments and popular readings;
and, in short, the Mechanics' Institute may be regarded
as one of the most civilising institutions in the place.</p>

<p>But my time in Majorca was drawing to an end.
One of the last public events in which I took part
was attending the funeral of our town clerk, the first
funeral I have ever had occasion to be present at. A
long procession followed his remains to the cemetery.
Almost all the men in the township attended, for the
deceased was highly respected. The service was very
solemn, held under the bright, clear, blue Australian
sky. Poor old man! I knew him well. I had seen
him so short a time ago in the hospital, where, three
hours before he died, he gave me his blessing. He was
then lying flushed, and in great pain. All that is over
now. "Dust to dust, and ashes to ashes." The earth
sounded as it fell upon his coffin; and now the good
man sleeps in peace, leaving a blessed memory behind
him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I was now under orders for home! My health was
completely re-established. I might have remained,
and perhaps succeeded in the colony. As it was,
I carried with me the best wishes of my employers.
But I had no desire to pursue the career of bank-clerk
further. I was learning but little, and had my
own proper business to pursue. So I made arrangements
for leaving Australia. Enough money had been
remitted me from England, to enable me to return
direct by first-class ship, leaving me free to choose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
my own route. As I might never have another opportunity
of seeing that great new country the United
States of America, the question occurred, whether I
might not be able to proceed up the Pacific to San
Francisco, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Honolulu, and cross America by the
Atlantic and Pacific Railway. On inquiry, I found it
would be practicable, but not by first-class. So I resolved
to rough it a little, and proceed by that route
second class, for which purpose my funds would be
sufficient. I accordingly took my final leave of Majorca
early in December&mdash;just as summer was reaching its
height; and after spending three more pleasant weeks
with my hospitable and kind friends in Melbourne,
took my passage in the steamer for Sydney, and set
sail the day after Christmas.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On looking over what I have above written about
my life in Victoria, I feel how utterly inadequate it is
to give the reader an idea of the country as a whole.
All that I have done has merely been to write down
my first impressions, unpremeditatedly and faithfully,
of what I saw, and what I felt and did while there.
Such a short residence in the colony, and such a limited
experience as mine was, could not have enabled me&mdash;no
matter what my faculty of observation, which is
but moderate&mdash;to convey any adequate idea of the
magnitude of the colony or its resources. To pretend
to write an account of Victoria and Victorian life from
the little I saw, were as absurd as it would be for a
native-born Victorian, sixteen years old, to come over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to England, live two years in a small country town,
and then write a book of his travels, headed "England."
And yet this is the way in which the Victorians complain,
and with justice, that they are treated by
English writers. Some eminent man arrives in the
colony, spends a few weeks in it, perhaps rushes through
it by railway, and hastens home to publish some contemptuous
account of the people whom he does not
really know, or some hasty if not fallacious description
of the country which he has not really seen. I am
sure that, however crude my description may be,
Victorians will not be offended with what I have said
of themselves and their noble colony; for, small
though the sphere of my observation was, they will
see that I have written merely to the extent of my
knowledge, and have related, as faithfully as I was
able, the circumstances that came within the range
of my own admittedly limited, but actual experience of
colonial life.</p>

Future Empire of the South</span>.</p>


<p>I spent my last Australian Christmas with my kind
entertainers in Melbourne. Christmas scarcely looks
like Christmas with the thermometer at 90&deg; in the
shade. But there is the same roast beef and plum-pudding
nevertheless, reminding one of home. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
immense garnishing of strawberries, however, now in
season&mdash;though extremely agreeable&mdash;reminds us that
Christmas at the Antipodes must necessarily differ in
many respects from Christmas in England.</p>

<p>The morning after Christmas Day saw me on board
the steamer 'Raugatira,' advertised to start for Sydney
at eleven. Casting off from our moorings at the
Sandridge pier, the ship got gradually under weigh;
and, waving my last adieu to friends on shore, I was
again at sea.</p>

<p>We steamed close alongside the 'Great Britain'&mdash;which
has for some time been the crack ship between
Australia and England. She had just arrived from
Liverpool with a great freight of goods and passengers,
and was lying at her moorings&mdash;a splendid ship. As
we steamed out into Hobson's Bay, Melbourne rose up
across the flats, and loomed large in the distance. All
the summits seemed covered with houses&mdash;the towers
of the fine Roman Catholic Cathedral, standing on the
top of a hill to the right, being the last building to be
seen distinctly from the bay.</p>

<p>In about two hours we were at Queenscliffe, inside
the Heads&mdash;at present the fashionable watering place of
Melbourne. Several excursion steamers had preceded
us, taking down great numbers of passengers, to enjoy
Boxing Day by the sea-side. The place looked very
pretty indeed from our ship's deck. Some of the
passengers, who had taken places for Sydney, were
landed here, fearing lest the sea should be found too
rough outside the Heads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been very little wind when we left
Sandridge, and the waters of Port Phillip were comparatively
smooth. But as we proceeded, the wind
began to rise, and our weather-wise friends feared lest
they should have to encounter a gale outside. We
were now in sight of the white line of breakers running
across the Heads. There was still a short distance of
smooth water before us; but that was soon passed; and
then our ship dashed her prow into the waves and had
to fight her way as for very life against the heavy sea
that rolled in through Bass's Straits from the South
Pacific.</p>

<p>The only distinguished passengers on board are
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mathews, who have been
"starring" it in Victoria to some purpose. A few
nights ago, Mr. Mathews took his leave in a characteristic
speech, partly humorous and partly serious; but
the enthusiastic audience laughed and cheered him all
the way through; and it was rather comic to read the
newspaper report of next morning, and to find that the
actor's passages of the softest pathos had been received
with "roars of laughter."</p>

<p>Mr. Mathews seems to be one of the most perennially
juvenile of men. When he came on board at Sandridge,
he looked as frisky and larky as a boy. He
skipped up and down the deck, and took an interest in
everything. This lasted so long as the water was
smooth. When he came in sight of the broken water
at the Heads, I fancy his spirit barometer went down a
little. But when the ship began to put her nose into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the waves freely, a total change seemed to pass over
him. I very soon saw his retreating skirts. For the
next three days&mdash;three long, rough, wave-tossing days&mdash;very
little was seen of him, and when he at length
did make his appearance on deck, alas! he seemed no
longer the brisk and juvenile passenger that had come
on board at Sandridge only a few days before.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a very rough and "dirty" passage.
The passengers were mostly prostrate during the whole
of the voyage. The sea was rolling in from the east in
great billows, which our little boat breasted gallantly;
but it was tossed about like a cork, inclining at all
sorts of angles by turns. It was not much that I could
see of the coast, though at some places it is bold, at
others beautiful. We passed very near to it at Ram
Head and Cape Howe&mdash;a grand promontory forming
the south-west point of Australia.</p>

<p>On the third day from Melbourne, about daybreak, I
found we were steaming close along shore, under dark
brown cliffs, not very high, topped with verdure. The
wind had gone down, but the boat was pitching in the
heavy sea as much as ever. The waves were breaking
with fury and noise along the beach under the
cliffs. At 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we passed Botany Bay&mdash;the first part
of New South Wales sighted by Captain Cook just a
hundred years ago. It was here that he first landed,
and erected a mound of stones and a flag to commemorate
the event.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Banks and Solander, who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
with him, found the land covered with new and beautiful
flowers, and hence the name which was given it, of
"Botany Bay"&mdash;afterwards a name of terror, associated
only with crime and convict life.</p>

<p>We steamed across the entrance to the bay, until we
were close under the cliffs of the outer South Head,
guarding the entrance to Port Jackson. The white
Macquarie lighthouse on the summit of the Head
is seen plainly at a great distance. Steaming on, we
were soon under the inner South Head, and at the
entrance to the famous harbour, said to be the finest
in the world.</p>

<p>The opening into Port Jackson is comparatively
narrow,&mdash;so much so, that when Captain Cook first
sailed past it, he considered it to be merely a boat
entrance, and did not examine it. While he was at
breakfast, the look-out man at the mast-head&mdash;a man
named Jackson&mdash;reported that he saw the entrance to
what seemed a good anchorage; and so the captain,
half in derision, named it "Port Jackson." The Heads
seemed to me only about four hundred feet apart from
each other, the North Head somewhat overlapping the
South. The rocks appear to have broken off abruptly,
and stand up perpendicularly over against each other,
about three hundred feet high, leaving a chasm or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
passage between them which forms the entrance to
Port Jackson. When the Pacific rolls in full force
against the Heads, the waves break with great violence
on the cliffs, and the spray is flung right over the lighthouse
on the South Head. Now that the sea has gone
somewhat down, the waves are not so furious, and yet
the dash of the spray half-way up the perpendicular
cliffs is a grand sight.</p>

<p>Once inside the Heads, the water becomes almost
perfectly calm; the scenery suddenly changes; the
cliffs subside into a prettily-wooded country, undulating
and sloping gently to the water's edge. Immediately
within the entrance, on the south side, is a
pretty little village&mdash;the pilot station in Watson's Bay.
After a few minutes' more steaming, the ship rounds a
corner, the open sea is quite shut out from view, and
neither Heads nor pilot station are to be seen.</p>

<p>My attention is next drawn to a charming view
on the north shore&mdash;a delicious little inlet, beautifully
wooded, and surrounded by a background of
hills, rising gradually to their highest height behind
the centre of the little bay. There, right in amongst
the bright green trees, I observe a gem of a house, with
a broad terrace in front, and steps leading down to the
clear blue water. A few minutes more, and we have
lost sight of the charming nook, having rounded the
headland of the inlet&mdash;a rocky promontory covered
with ferns and mosses.</p>

<p>But our attention is soon absorbed by other beauties
of the scene. Before us lies a lovely island prettily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
wooded, with some three or four fine mansions and
their green lawns sloping down to the water's edge;
while on the left, the hills are constantly varying in
aspect as we steam along. At length, some seven
miles up Port Jackson, the spires and towers and
buildings of Sydney come into sight; at first Wooloomooloo,
and then in ten minutes more, on rounding
another point, we find ourselves in Sydney Cove,
alongside the wharf. Here we are in the midst of an
amphitheatre of beauty,&mdash;a wooded island opposite
covered with villas and cottages; with headlands, coves
and bays, and beautiful undulations of lovely country
as far as the eye can reach. Altogether, I think Port
Jackson is one of the most charming pieces of water
and landscape that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>After our three days tossing at sea, I was, however,
glad to be on shore again; so, having seen my boxes
safely deposited in the Californian baggage dep&ocirc;t, I
proceeded into the town and secured apartments for
the few days I was to remain in Sydney.</p>

<p>From what I have already said of the approach to
the landing, it will be inferred that the natural situation
of Sydney is very fine. It stands upon a ridge of sandstone
rock, which runs down into the bay in numerous
ridges or spines of land or rock, between which lie the
natural harbours of the place; and these are so deep,
that vessels of almost any burden may load and unload
at the projecting wharves. Thus Sydney possesses a
very large extent of deep water frontage, and its wharfage
and warehouse accommodation is capable of enlargement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to almost any extent. Of the natural harbours
formed by the projecting spines of rock into the deep
water, the most important are Wooloomooloo Bay,
Farm Cove, Sydney Cove, and Darling Harbour.</p>

<p>From the waterside, the houses, ranged in streets,
rise like so many terraces up to the crown of the
ridges,&mdash;the main streets occupying the crests and
flanks of two or three of the highest. One of these,
George Street, is a remarkably fine street, about two
miles long, containing many handsome buildings.</p>

<p>My first knowledge of Sydney was acquired in a
stroll up George Street. We noticed the original old
market-place, bearing the date of 1793; a quaint
building, with queer old-fashioned domes, all shingle-roofed.
A little further on, we came to a large building
in course of erection&mdash;the new Town Hall, built
of a yellowish sort of stone. Near it is the English
Cathedral&mdash;a large and elegant structure. Further
on, is the new Roman Catholic Cathedral,&mdash;the original
cathedral in Hyde Park having been burnt down
some time ago.</p>

<p>Altogether, Sydney has a much older look than
Melbourne. It has grown up at longer intervals, and
does not look so spic and span new. The streets are
much narrower and more irregular&mdash;older-fashioned,
and more English in appearance&mdash;occasioned, doubtless,
by its slower growth and its more hilly situation.
But it would also appear as if there were not the
same go-ahead spirit in Sydney that so pre-eminently
characterises her sister city. Instead of the splendidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
broad, well-paved, and well-watered streets of Melbourne,
here they are narrow, ill-paved, and dirty.
Such a thing as the miserable wooden hut which serves
for a post-office would not be allowed to exist for a
day at Melbourne. It is the original office, and has
never been altered or improved since it was first put
up. I must, however, acknowledge that a new post-office
is in course of erection; but it shows the want
of public spirit in the place that the old shanty should
have been allowed to stand so long.</p>

<p>The railway terminus, at the end of George Street,
is equally discreditable. It is, without exception, the
shabbiest, dirtiest shed of the kind I have ever seen.
They certainly need a little of the Victorian spirit in
Sydney. The Melbourne people, with such a site for a
city, would soon have made it one of the most beautiful
places in the world. As it is, nothing can surpass its
superb situation; the view over the harbour from some
of the higher streets being unequalled,&mdash;the numerous
ships lying still, as if asleep on the calm waters of the
bay beneath, whilst the rocky promontories all round
it, clothed with verdure, are dotted with the villas and
country mansions of the Sydney merchants.</p>

<p>One of the busiest parts of Sydney is down by the
quays, where a great deal of shipping business is carried
on. There are dry docks, patent slips, and one floating
dock; though floating docks are of minor importance
here, where the depth of water along shore is so great,
and the rise and fall of the tide is so small. Indeed,
Sydney Harbour may be regarded as one immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
floating dock. The Australasian Steam Navigation
Company have large ship-building and repairing premises
at Pyrmont, which give employment to a large
number of hands. Certainly, the commanding position
of Sydney, and the fact of its being the chief port of a
great agricultural and pastoral country in the interior,
hold out the promise of great prosperity for it in the
future.</p>

<p>Every visitor to Sydney of course makes a point of
seeing the Government House and the Domain, for it
is one of the principal sights of the place. The
Government buildings and park occupy the double-headed
promontory situated between Wooloomooloo
Bay and Sydney Cove. The Government House is a
handsome and spacious castellated building, in every
way worthy of the colony; the views from some parts
of the grounds being of almost unparalleled beauty.
There are nearly four miles of drives in the park,
through alternate cleared and wooded grounds,&mdash;sometimes
opening upon cheerful views of the splendid
harbour, then skirting the rocky shores, or retreating
inland amidst shadowy groves and grassy dells. The
grounds are open to the public, and the entrances
being close upon the town and suburbs, this public
park of Sydney is one that for convenience and beauty,
perhaps no capital in the world surpasses.</p>

<p>The Botanical Gardens are situated in what is called
the outer Domain. We enter the grounds under a
long avenue of acacias and sycamores, growing so close
together as to afford a complete shade from the noonday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
heat. At the end of the avenue, we came upon a
splendid specimen of the Norfolk Island pine, said to
be the largest and finest tree out of the island itself.
After resting for a time under its delicious shade, we
strolled on through other paths overhung with all sorts
of flowering plants; then, passing through an opening
in the wall, a glorious prospect of the bay suddenly
spread out before us. The turf was green down to the
water's edge, and interspersed with nicely-kept flower
beds, with here and there a pretty clump of trees.</p>

<p>Down by the water side is a broad esplanade&mdash;the
most charming of promenades&mdash;running all round the
beautiful little bay which it encloses. Tropical and
European shrubs grow in profusion on all sides; an
English rose-tree in full bloom growing alongside a
bamboo; while, at another place, a banana throws its
shadow over a blooming bunch of sweet pea, and a bell-flowered
plant overhangs a Michaelmas daisy. A fine
view of the harbour and shipping is obtained from a
part of the grounds where Lady Macquarie's chair&mdash;a
hollow place in a rock&mdash;is situated;&mdash;itself worth
coming a long way to see. Turning up the gardens
again, we come upon a monkey-house, an aviary, and&mdash;what
interested me more than all&mdash;an enclosed lawn in
which were numerous specimens of the kangaroo tribe,
from the "Old Boomer" standing six feet high, down to
the Rock kangaroo not much bigger than a hare. We
hung about, watching the antics of the monkeys and
the leapings of the kangaroos until it was time to take
our departure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>The country inland, lying to the south of Sydney, is
by no means picturesque. Much of it consists of sandy
scrub, and it is by no means fertile, except in the
valleys. But nothing can surpass the beauty of the
shores of the bay as far up as Paramatta, about twenty
miles inland. The richest land of the colony lies well
into the interior, but the time at my disposal was too
short to enable me to do more than visit the capital,
with which the passing stranger cannot fail to be
greatly pleased.</p>

<p>Altogether, it seems a wonderful thing that so much
should have been done within so short a time towards
opening up the resources of this great country. And
most wonderful of all, that the people of a small island
like Britain, situated at the very opposite side of the
globe, some sixteen thousand miles off, should have
come hither, and within so short a time have built up
such cities as Sydney and Melbourne,&mdash;planted so large
an extent of territory with towns, and villages, and farmsteads&mdash;covered
its pastures with cattle and sheep&mdash;opened
up its mines&mdash;provided it with roads, railroads,
and telegraphs, and thereby laid the firm foundations of
a great future empire in the south. Surely these are
things of which England, amidst all her grumblings,
has some reason to be proud!</p>

<p>On the last day of December, 1870, I set out for
Honolulu, in the Sandwich Islands, embarking as second-class
passenger on board the 'City of Melbourne.' Our
first destination was Auckland, in New Zealand, where we
were to stop for a few days to take in passengers and mails.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been so fortunate as accidentally to encounter
a friend, whom I knew in Maryborough, in the streets
of Sydney. He was out upon his summer holiday, and
when he understood that I was bound for New Zealand,
he determined to accompany me, and I had, therefore,
the pleasure of his society during the earlier part of my
voyage.</p>

<p>As we steamed down the harbour I had another
opportunity of admiring the beautiful little bays, and
sandy coves, and wooded islets of Port Jackson. The
city, with its shipping, and towers, and spires, gradually
receded in the distance, and as we rounded a headland
Sydney was finally shut out from further view.</p>

<p>We were soon close to the abrupt headlands which
guard the entrance to the bay, and letting drop our
anchor just inside the southern head, we lay safely
sheltered from the gale which began to blow from
the east. There we waited the arrival of the 'City of
Adelaide' round from Melbourne, with the last mails
and passengers for England by the California route.</p>

<p>But it was some time before the 'Adelaide' made
her appearance. Early next morning, hearing that
she was alongside, I hurried on deck. The mails
were speedily brought off from the inward-bound ship,
together with seven more passengers. Our anchor was
at once weighed, and in ten more minutes we are off.
We are soon at the entrance to the Heads; and I see
by the scud of the clouds, and the long line of foaming
breakers driving across the entrance, that before long
we shall have the spray flying over our hurricane deck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Another minute and we are outside, plunging into the
waves and throwing the water in foam from our bows.</p>

<p>I remain upon deck, holding on as long as I can.
Turning back, I see a fine little schooner coming out of
the Heads behind us, under a good press of sail. On
she came, dipping her bows right under the water, but
buoyant as a cork. Her men were aloft reefing a sail,
her yards seeming almost to touch the water as she
leaned over to leeward. Passing under our stern, she
changed her course, and the plucky little schooner held
up along the coast, making for one of the northern
ports.</p>

<p>Taking a last look at the Sydney Heads, I left the
further navigation of the ship in the hands of the
captain, and retired below. I was too much occupied
by private affairs to see much more of the sea during
the next twenty-four hours. New Year's Day though
it was, there was very little jollity on board; indeed,
as regarded the greater number of the passengers, it
was spent rather sadly.</p>

<p>The weather, however, gradually moderated, until, on
the third day of our voyage, it became fine, such wind
as there was being well aft. On the fifth day, the wind
had gone quite down, and there only remained the long
low roll of the Pacific; but the ship rolled so heavily
that I suspect there must have been a very strong
under-current somewhere about. Early in the forenoon
we sighted the "Three Kings' Island," off the
extreme north coast of New Zealand. At first they
seemed to consist of three detached rocks; but as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
neared them, they were seen to be a number of small
rocky islands, with very little vegetation on them.
The mainland shortly came in sight, though it was still
too distant to enable us to recognise its features.</p>

<p>Early next morning, we found ourselves steaming
close in shore past Cape Brett, near the entrance to the
Bay of Islands. The high cliffs along the coast are bold
and grand; here and there a waterfall is seen, and
occasionally an opening valley, showing the green
woods beyond. In the distance are numerous conical
hills, showing the originally volcanic character of the
country. During the forenoon we passed a huge rock
that in the distance had the appearance of being a
large ship in full sail; hence its name of the "Sail
Rock."</p>

<p>The entrance to the harbour of Auckland, though by
no means equal to Port Jackson, is yet highly picturesque.
On one side is the city of Auckland, lying
in a hollow, and extending up the steep hills on either
side; while opposite to it, on the north shore of the
Frith of Thames, is a large round hill, used as a pilot
signal station. Situated underneath it are many nice
little villas, with gardens close to the sea. The view
extends up the inlets, which widens out and terminates
in a background of high blue mountains. From Auckland,
as from Sydney, the open sea is not to be seen&mdash;there
are so many windings in and out before the
harbour is reached.</p>

<p>A fine Queen's ship was lying at anchor in the bay,
which, on inquiry, we found to be the 'Galatea,' commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
by the Duke of Edinburgh. The 'Clio' also
was anchored not far off. We were soon alongside the
long wooden pier, to which were also moored several fine
clipper ships, and made our way into the town. As
the principal street continued straight in from the pier,
we were shortly enabled to see all the principal buildings
of the place.</p>

<p>Though a small shipping town, there seems to be a
considerable amount of business doing at Auckland.
There is a good market-place, some creditable bank
buildings, and some three or four fine shops, but the
streets are dirty and ill-paved. The Supreme Court and
the Post Office&mdash;both fine buildings&mdash;lie off the principal
street. The Governor's house, which occupies a
hill to the right, commands a fine view of the bay, as
well as of the lovely green valley behind it.</p>

<p>Auckland, like Sydney, being for the most part built
upon high land, is divided by ravines, which open out
towards the sea in little coves or bays&mdash;such as Mechanics'
Bay, Commercial Bay, and Official Bay. The
buildings in Mechanics' Bay, as the name imports, are
principally devoted to ship-building, boat-building, and
rope-making. The shore of Commercial Bay is occupied
by the store and shop-keeping people, while Official
Bay is surrounded by the principal official buildings,
the Government storehouses, and such like.</p>

<p>I have been told here that Auckland is completely
out of place as the capital of the colony, being situated
at the narrowest part of the island, far away from the
principal seats of population, which are in Cook's Straits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and even further south. The story is current that Auckland
is due to an early job of Government officials, who
combined to buy up the land about it and when it had
been fixed upon as the site of the capital, sold out their
lots at fabulous prices, to the feathering of their own
nests.</p>

<p>A great many natives, or Maoris, are hanging about
the town. It seems that they are here in greater
numbers than usual, their votes being wanted for the
passing or confirmation of some land measure. Groups
of them stand about the streets talking and gesticulating;
a still greater number are hanging round the
public-houses, which they enter from time to time to
have a drink. I cannot say I like the look of the
men; they look very ugly customers indeed&mdash;beetle-browed
and down-looking, "with foreheads villanous
low." Their appearance is all the more revolting by
reason of the large blue circles of tattoo on their faces.
Indeed, when the New Zealander is fully tattooed,
which is the case with the old aristocrats, there is very
little of his original face visible, excepting perhaps his
nose and his bright black eyes.</p>

<p>Most of the men were dressed in the European costume,
though some few were in their native blankets,
which they wear with grace and even dignity. The
men were of fine physique&mdash;tall, strong, and well-made&mdash;and,
looking at their keen fierce eyes, I do not wonder
that they have given our soldiers so much trouble.
I could not help thinking, as I saw them hanging about
the drinking-shops, some half drunk, that English drink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
will in the long run prove their conquerors far more
than English rifles.</p>

<p>There were many Maori women mingled with the
men. Some of them were good looking. Their skin
is of a clear dark olive; their eyes dark brown or
black; their noses small and their mouths large. But
nearly all of them have a horrid blue tattoo mark on
their lips, that serves to give them&mdash;at least to European
eyes&mdash;a repulsive look.</p>

<p>Many of the women, as well as the men, wear a
piece of native greenstone hanging from their ears, to
which is attached a long piece of black ribbon. This
stone is supposed by the Maoris to possess some magical
virtue. Others of them&mdash;men, as well as girls&mdash;have
sharks' teeth hanging from their ears and dangling
about their faces,&mdash;the upper part of the teeth being
covered with bright red wax.</p>

<p>Mixed with the Maoris were the sailors of the
'Galatea,' rolling about the streets, and, like them,
frequent customers of the public-houses. In fact, the
sailors and the Maoris seemed to form a considerable
proportion of the population of the place.</p>

<p>The landlord of the hotel at which we stayed&mdash;the
'Waitemata'&mdash;having recommended us to take a drive
into the interior, we set out at midday by stage coach
for Onehunga. Auckland being situated at the narrowest
part of the North Island, Onehunga, which is
on the west coast, is only seven miles distant by land,
though five hundred by water.</p>

<p>The coach started at noon, and it was hard work for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the four horses to drag the vehicle up the long steep
hill at the back of the town. Nice country-houses
stood on both sides of the road, amidst fresh green
gardens; the houses almost buried in foliage.</p>

<p>From the high road a magnificent landscape
stretched before us. It reminded me very much of
a particular view of the Lake of Geneva, though this
was even more grand and extensive. The open sea
was at such a distance, and so shut out by intervening
high land, that it was scarcely visible. The lovely
frith or bay, with its numerous inlets, islands, and
surrounding bright green hills, lay at our feet. The
blue water wound in and out amongst the hills on our
right for a distance of about fifteen miles. There was a
large open stretch of water, surrounded by high mountains,
towards the west. Right before us was the entrance
to the bay, with the pilot-station hill on one side
and Mount Victoria on the other. Between these two
hills, high land stood up in the distance, so that the
whole gave one the impression of a beautiful inland
lake rather than of a sea view. It was, without exception,
the most magnificent prospect I had ever looked
upon. Yet they tell me this is surpassed by the scenery
in other parts of New Zealand; in which case it must
indeed be an exceedingly picturesque country.</p>

<p>We drove along through a pretty green country, with
fine views of the plains toward the right, bounded by
distant blue mountains. In about another quarter of
an hour, after passing through the village of Epsom,
we came in sight of the sea on the west coast, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
shortly set down at Onehunga, on the shore of Manukau
Bay. Onehunga is a small township, containing a few
storehouses, besides dwelling-houses, with an hotel or
two. The view here was also fine, but not so interesting
as that on the eastern side of the island. Plains,
bounded by distant mountains, extended along the
coast on one side, and high broken cliffs ran along
the shore and bounded the sea in front of us. After
an hour's rest, at Onehunga, we returned to Auckland,
enjoying the drive back very much, in spite of the
inconveniently-crowded coach.</p>

<p>There was a sort of gala in Auckland that evening.
A promenade concert was given on the parade-ground
at the barracks, at which the band of the 'Galatea'
played to the company. The Prince himself, it was
announced, would perform on the occasion. It was a
fine moonlight night, and the inhabitants of Auckland
turned out in force. There must have been at least
two thousand well-dressed people promenading about,
listening to the music. The Prince's elephant was there
too, and afforded a good deal of amusement. How the
poor brute was slung out of the 'Galatea,' got on shore,
and got back on ship-board again, was to me a mystery.</p>

<p>I went down to the steamer at the appointed time of
sailing, but found that the 'City' was not to leave for
several hours after time. The mail express was to wait
until Mr. and Mrs. Bandman&mdash;who had been acting in
Auckland&mdash;had received some presentation from the
officers of the 'Galatea'! It seemed odd that a mail
steamer should be delayed some hours to suit the convenience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of a party of actors. But there are strange
doings connected with this mail line. Time is of little
moment here; and, in New Zealand, I suspect time is
even less valued than usual. They tell me that few
mails leave New Zealand without having to wait, on
some pretext or another. There does not seem to
be the same activity, energy, and business aptitude
that exists in the Australian colonies. The Auckland
people seem languid and half asleep. Perhaps their
soft, relaxing, winterless climate has something to do
with it.</p>

<p>Having nothing else to occupy me before the ship
sailed, I took leave of my Australian friend, gave him
my last messages for Maryborough and Majorca, and
went on board. I was wakened up about midnight
by the noise of the anchor coming up; and, in a few
minutes more, we were off and on our way to Honolulu
up the Pacific.</p>

<p>When I went on deck next morning, we had left New
Zealand far behind us; not a speck of land was to be
seen, and we were fairly on our way to Honolulu. We
have before us a clear run of about four thousand miles,
and if our machinery and coal keep good, we know that
we shall do it easily in about seventeen days.</p>

<p>Strange though it may seem, there is much greater
monotony in a voyage on board a steamer than there is
on board a sailing vessel. There is nothing like the
same interest felt in the progress of the ship, and thus
one unfailing topic of conversation and speculation is
shut out. There are no baffling winds, no sleeping
calms, alternating with a joyous and invigorating run
before the wind, such as we had when coming out, from
Plymouth to the Cape. We only know that we shall
do our average ten miles an hour, be the weather what
it may. If the wind is blowing astern, we run before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
it; if ahead, we run through it. Fair or foul it matters
but little.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/image213.png" width="592" height="600" alt="(Maps of the Ship&#39;s Course up the Pacific, Auckland,
and Sydney, Port Jackson)" title="Auckland, New Zealand." />
</p>

<p>A voyage by a steamer, compared with one by sailing
ship, is what a journey by railway train is to a drive
across country in a well-horsed stage coach. There is,
however, this to be said in favour of the former,&mdash;we
know that, monotonous though it be, it is very much
sooner over; and on a voyage of some thousands of
miles, we can calculate to a day, and almost to an hour,
when we shall arrive at our destination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>But, to be set against the shorter time consumed on
the voyage, there are numerous little <i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>.
There is the dismal, never-ending grind, grind of the
screw, sometimes, when the ship rolls, and the screw
is out of the water, going round with a horrible <i>birr</i>.
At such times, the vessel has a double motion, pitching
and rolling, and thereby occasioning an inexpressibly
sickly feeling. Then, when the weather is hot, there
is the steam of heated oil wafted up from the engine-room,
which, mingled with the smell of bilge, and
perhaps cooking, is anything but agreeable or appetizing.
I must also acknowledge that a second-class
berth, which I had taken, is not comparable in point of
comfort to a first; not only as regards the company,
but as regards smells, food, and other surroundings.</p>

<p>There are not many passengers at my end, and the
few there are do not make themselves very agreeable.
First, there are two German Jews, grumbling and
growling at everything. They are a couple of the
most cantankerous fellows I ever came across; never
done knagging, swearing, grunting, and bellowing.
They keep the steward, who is an obliging sort of
fellow, in a state of constant "wax;" which, when I
want anything done for me, I have to remedy by
tipping. So that they are likely to prove somewhat
costly companions, though in a peculiar way.</p>

<p>Next, there is a German Yankee, a queer old fellow,
who came on board at Auckland. He seems to have
made some money at one of the New Zealand gold
fields called "The Serpentine," somewhere near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Dunedin. This old fellow and I cotton together very
well. He is worth a dozen of the other two Germans.
He had been all through the American war under
Grant, and spins some long yarns about the Northerners
and the "cussed rebs."</p>

<p>As there are twenty-seven bunks in our cabin, and
only four passengers, there is of course plenty of room
and to spare. But there is also a "lady" passenger at
our end of the ship, and she has all the fifteen sleeping-places
in her cabin to herself. It might be supposed
that, there being only one lady, she would be in considerable
demand with her fellow-passengers. But it
was quite the contrary. Miss Ribbids, as I will call
her, proved to be a most uninteresting individual. I am
sorry to have to confess to so much ungallantry; but
the only effort which I made, in common with the
others, was to avoid her&mdash;she was so hopelessly dense.
One night she asked me, quite seriously, "If that was
the same moon they had at Sydney?"! I am sure she
does not know that the earth is round. By stretching
a hair across the telescope glass, I made her look in
and showed her the Line, but she did not see the joke.
She gravely asked if we should not land at the Line:
she understood there was land there! Her only humour
is displayed at table, when anything is spilt by the rolling
of the ship, when she exclaims, "Over goes the apple-cart!"
But enough of the awful Miss Ribbids.</p>

<p>There are, however, other passengers aboard that
must not be forgotten&mdash;the rats! I used to have a
horror of rats, but here I soon became used to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
The first night I slept on board I smelt something very
disgusting as I got into my bunk; and at last I discovered
that it arose from a dead rat in the wainscot of
the ship. My nose being somewhat fastidious as yet, I
moved to the other side of the cabin. But four kegs of
strong-smelling butter sent me quickly out of that. I
then tried a bunk next to the German Jews, but I found
proximity to them was the least endurable of all; and
so, after many changes, I at last came back and slept
contentedly beside my unseen and most unsavoury companion,
the dead rat.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of living and very lively rats
too. One night a big fellow ran over my face, and in a
fright I cried out. But use is everything, and in the
course of a few more nights I got quite rid of my
childish astonishment and fear at rats running over my
face. Have you ever heard rats sing? I assure you
they sing in a very lively chorus; though I confess I
have heard much pleasanter music in my time.</p>

<p>Amidst all these little troubles, the ship went steadily
on. During the second night, after leaving Auckland,
the wind began to blow pretty fresh, and the hatch was
closed. It felt very close and stuffy below, that night.
The light went out, and the rats had it all their own
way. On the following day, it was impossible to go on
deck without getting wet through, so we were forced to
stick down below. The rolling of the ship was also
considerable.</p>

<p>Next day was fine, but hot. The temperature
sensibly and even rapidly increases as we approach the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Line. We see no land, though we have passed through
amongst the Friendly Islands, with the Samoa or
Navigator's Islands lying to the west. It is now a
clear course to Honolulu. Not being able to go on
deck in the heat of the day, at risk of sun-stroke, I
wait until the sun has gone down, and then slip on
deck with my rug and pillow, and enjoy a siesta under
the stars. But sometimes I am disturbed by a squall,
and have to take refuge below again.</p>

<p>As the heat increases, so do the smells on board. In
passing from the deck to our cabin, I pass through
seven distinct perfumes:&mdash;1st, the smell from the
galley smoke; 2nd, the perfume of decaying vegetables
stored on the upper deck; 3rd, fowls; 4th, dried
fish; 5th, oil and steam from the engine-room; 6th,
meat undergoing the process of cooking; 7th, the galley
by which I pass; until I finally enter No. 8, our own
sweet cabin, with the butter, the rats, and the German
Jews.</p>

<p>We are again in the midst of the flying fish; but
they interest me nothing like so vividly as they did
when I first saw them in the Atlantic. Some of them
take very long flights, as much as thirty or forty yards.
Whole shoals of them fly away from the bows of the
ship as she presses through the water.</p>

<p>On the 19th of January we crossed the Line, in longitude
about 160&deg;. We continue on a straight course,
making an average of about 240 miles a day. It
already begins to get cooler, as we are past the sun's
greatest heat. It is a very idle, listless life; and I lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
about on the hen-coops all day, reading, or sitting
down now and then to write up this log, which has
been written throughout amidst discomfort and under
considerable difficulties.</p>

<p>One of my fellow-passengers is enraged at the manner
in which newspapers are treated while in transit. If
what he says be true, I can easily understand how it is
that so many newspapers miscarry&mdash;how so many
numbers of 'Punch' and the 'Illustrated News' never
reach their destination. My informant says that when
an officer wants a newspaper, the mail-bag is opened,
and he takes what he likes. He might just as well be
permitted to have letters containing money. Many
a poor colonial who cannot write a letter, buys and
despatches a newspaper to his friends at home, to let
them know he is alive; and this is the careless and
unfaithful way in which the missive is treated by
those to whom its carriage is entrusted. I heard
many complaints while in Victoria, of newspapers containing
matter of interest never reaching their address;
from which I infer that the same practice more or
less prevails on the Atlantic route. It is really too bad.</p>

<p>As we steam north, the weather grows fine, and we
begin to have some splendid days and glorious sunsets.
But we are all longing eagerly to arrive at our destination.
At length, on the morning of the 24th of
January, we discerned the high land of the island
of Hawaii, about seventy miles off, on our beam. That
is the island where Captain Cook was murdered by the
natives, in 1779. We saw distinctly the high conical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
volcanic mountain of Mauna Loa, 14,000 feet high, its
peak showing clear above the grey clouds.</p>

<p>We steamed on all day, peering ahead, looking out
for the land. Night fell, and still our port was not in
sight. At length, at about ten, the lighthouse on the
reef which stretches out in front of Honolulu, shone
out in the darkness. Then began a little display of
fireworks, and rockets and blue lights were exchanged
between our ship and the shore. A rocket also shot up
from a steamer to seaward, and she was made out to
be the 'Moses Taylor,' the ship that is to take us on
to San Francisco.</p>

<p>At about one in the morning, we take our pilot on
board, and shortly after, my German friends rouse me
with the intelligence that we are alongside the wharf.
I am now, however, getting an "old bird;" my enthusiasm
about novelty has gone down considerably; and
I decline the pleasure of accompanying them on shore
at this early hour. Honolulu will doubtless wait for
me until morning.</p>

<p>When I came on deck in the early morning, the sun
was rising behind the mountains which form the background
of Honolulu as seen from the harbour, tipping
them with gold and red, and bathing the landscape in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
beauty. I could now survey at leisure the lovely
scene.</p>

<p>I found we had entered a noble harbour, round which
the town of Honolulu is built, with its quays, warehouses
and shipyards. Looking seaward, I observe the
outer bay is nearly closed in at its lower extremity by
the long ridge-like hill, called Diamond Head. Nearer
at hand, behind the town, is a remarkable eminence
called Punchbowl Hill, evidently of volcanic origin,
crowned with a battery, and guarding the entrance to
the smaller bay which forms the harbour.</p>

<p>The entrance to the harbour is through a passage in
one of the coral reefs which surround the island, the
coral insects building upwards from the submerged
flanks of the land, until the reefs emerge from the
waves, more or less distant from the shore. As the
water at the shallowest part of the entrance is only
about twenty-two feet, vessels of twenty-feet draught
and over have to remain outside, where, however, there
is good anchorage and shelter, unless when the wind
blows strong from the south. The water inside the
reefs is usually smooth, though the waves outside may
be dashing themselves to foam on their crests.</p>

<p>A glance at the situation of the Sandwich Islands on
the map will serve to show the important part they are
destined to play in the future commerce of the Pacific.
They lie almost directly in the course of all ships
passing from San Francisco and Vancouver to China
and Japan, as well as to New Zealand and Australia.
They are almost equidistant from the coasts of Russia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and America, being rather nearer to the American
coast, from which they are distant about 2100 miles.
They form, as it were, a stepping-stone on the great
ocean highway of the Pacific between the East and the
West&mdash;between
the old world
and the new&mdash;as
well as between
the newest and
most prosperous
settlements in
the Western States of America and Australia. And it
is because Honolulu&mdash;the principal town in the island
of Oahu, and the capital of the Sandwich Islands&mdash;possesses
by far the best, most accessible, and convenient
harbour, that it is a place likely to become of so much
importance in the future. It has not been unusual to
see as many as from a hundred to a hundred and fifty
sail riding securely at anchor there.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 549px;"><a name="Map_of_Oahu" id="Map_of_Oahu"></a>
<img src="images/image222.jpg" width="549" height="300" alt="(Map of Oahu, Sandwich Islands)" title="(Map of Oahu, Sandwich Islands)" />
</p>

<p>As seen from the harbour, Honolulu is an extremely
pretty place. It lies embowered in fresh green foliage,
the roofs of the houses peeping up here and there from
amongst the trees, while the waving fronds of the
cocoa-nut palms rise in some places majestically above
them, contrasting strangely with the volcanic crags
and peaks which form the distant background. In the
older part of the town, to the right, the houses are more
scattered about; and from the first appearance of the
place, one would scarcely suppose that it contained so
large a population as twelve thousand, though many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the houses are doubtless hidden by the foliage and the
undulations of the ground on which the place is built.</p>

<p>Behind the town, a plain of about two miles in width
extends to the base of the mountain range which forms
its background. The extraordinary shapes of the
mountains&mdash;their rugged ravines and precipitous peaks&mdash;unmistakably
denote the volcanic agencies that have
been at work in forming the islands, and giving to the
scenery its most marked features. Just at the back of
the town, a deep valley, or rather gorge, runs through a
break in the hills, the sides of which are covered with
bright green foliage. The country, which rises gradually
up to this break in the mountains, is exceedingly
picturesque. Altogether, the first sight of the place
came fully up to my anticipations of the beauty of a
tropical town in the Pacific.</p>

<p>I proceeded to take my first walk through Honolulu
at half-past five in the morning. It was the 25th of
January&mdash;the dead of winter; but there is no winter
in Honolulu. It is as warm as August is in England;
and the warmth of the place all the year through is
testified by the fact that there is not a dwelling-house
chimney in the town. I walked along the shady
streets up to the market-place, and there I found a
number of the natives squatted on their haunches,
selling plantains, oranges, bananas, fruits, and vegetables.
I invested sixpence in an enormous bunch of
bananas, which I carried back with me to the ship for
the use of our party, very much to their enjoyment,
for the fruit was in perfection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon I proceeded to explore
Honolulu at greater leisure. I found the central
portion of the town consisted of regularly laid out
streets, many of the houses enclosed within gardens.
The trees standing here and there amongst the shops
and warehouses give them a fresh and primitive look.
I pass several places of worship in going to the Post
Office,&mdash;the English Cathedral, chapels of American
Congregationalists, Wesleyan Methodists, and Roman
Catholics. There is also the Royal Hawaiian Theatre,
and an Equestrian Circus, as well as a Police Office.
Police? "Yes; bless you, sir, we are civilised!"</p>

<p>I could see the Post Office a long way off before
I reached it, standing in a small square at the head of
one of the principal streets. It was easily known by
the crowd of people, both natives and foreigners, on
the steps. For the mail had just come in by the
'Moses Taylor,' and everybody was anxious to know
what had been the upshot of the European war and
the siege of Paris. That war even threatens to disturb
the peace of Honolulu itself; for there is now a French
man-of-war at anchor in the harbour, the 'Hamelin,'
watching a fine German merchant ship, the 'Count
Bismarck,' that arrived a few days before the Frenchman.
The Germans have taken the precaution to paint
"Honolulu" on the stern of their vessel, and to place
themselves under the protection of the Hawaiian
Government. So the commander of the French ship,
finding he can make no capture here, has weighed
anchor and steamed out of port, doubtless to lie in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
wait for the German vessel outside should she venture
to put to sea.</p>

<p>I found the Post Office a sort of joint post-office and
stationer's shop, the principal business consisting in the
sale of newspapers. I was amazed to find that though
a steamer runs regularly from Honolulu to Australia
there is no postal communication with Victoria, except
<i>vi&acirc;</i> America and England! This is on account of the
Victorian Government refusing to subsidize the new
Californian and Australian mail line. Should such a
line become established and prosper, the Victorians
fear that an advantage would be given to Sydney, and
that Melbourne, instead of being on the main line of
mail communication, as it now is, would be shunted on
to a branch. But surely there is room enough for
a mail line by both the Atlantic and Pacific routes,
without occasion for jealousy either on the part of
Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>After settling my business at the Post Office, accompanied
by my German-Yankee fellow-passenger, I took
a stroll round the town and suburbs; though it is so
open and green that it seems <i>all</i> suburbs. We invested
a small sum in oranges, which we found in perfection,
and sucked them as we went along in the most undignified
way possible. We directed our steps to that
part of the town where the better class seemed to reside,
in cool, shady lanes, the houses embowered in large-leaved
tropical trees, cocoa-nut, banana, bread-fruit,
calabash, and other palms, with cycas and tree-ferns
with stems some fifteen feet high. Flower-bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
shrubs also abounded, such as the Hibiscus, Mairi, of
which the women make wreaths, and Gardenia, with
the flowers of which they also adorn themselves. In
some of the gardens water was laid on, and pretty fountains
were playing, from which it would appear that
the water supply is good, and that there is a good head
of it in some mountain reservoir above.</p>

<p>We strolled along to the right of the town, towards
the high volcanic mountain on which the fort is situated,
the long extinct crater showing plainly on its summit.
Some years since, when a French ship bombarded the
town, the Kanakas who manned the fort, threw down
their sponges, rammers, and all, directly the first shot
was fired, leaving the fort to take care of itself.</p>

<p>We returned to the harbour by way of the King's
palace, which is in the centre of the town, and may be
known by the royal flag floating over it. The palace
is built of coral stone, and is an unpretending building,
reminding one of a French <i>maison de campagne</i>. It
stands in about an acre of ground, ornamented with
flowers, shrubs, and an avenue of kukui and koa-trees.
A native sentry stood at the gate in his uniform of
blue coat and white trousers, and with his musket
duly shouldered in regulation style.</p>

<p>On the following day I made an excursion with an
American gentleman, who is something of a naturalist,
to the remarkable valley, or gorge, in the mountains at
the back of the town, which had so attracted my notice
when I first saw it from the deck of our ship. It is
called the Nuuanu Valley, and is well worthy of a visit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
The main street of the town leads directly up to the
entrance to the valley; and on the road we passed
many pretty low-roofed houses surrounded by beautifully-kept
gardens, the houses being those of the chief
merchants and consuls of the port. They looked quite
cool and pleasant, embowered in green papyrus, tamarind,
and palm-trees, which shaded them from the hot
tropical sun with their large-leaved foliage. I find the
sun now, in winter-time, so hot that it is almost intolerable.
What must it be in summer?</p>

<p>As we proceed, we reach the fertile land, which
nearly all lies at the foot of the mountains, the long
disintegration of the high ground having left a rich
deposit for vegetable growth. Some patches of arrowroot
lie close to the road, irrigated by the streams that
run down from the mountain above. But the principal
crop is the taro-plant (<i>Arum esculentum</i>), from which
the native food of <i>poi</i> is made. Let me say a few words
about this <i>poi</i>, as it forms the main staple of Hawaiian
food. The taro is grown in pits or beds, kept very wet,&mdash;in
which case, urged by the natural heat of the climate,
it grows with immense rapidity and luxuriance. It is
the succulent root which is used for food. It is pounded
into a semi-fluid mess, after which it is allowed to stand
a few days and ferment; it is then worked about with
the hands until it acquires the proper consistency for
eating, when it is stored in gourds and calabashes. It
must be of a certain thickness, neither too soft nor too
firm, something of the consistency of thick flour-paste,
though glutinous, and it is eaten in the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
manner. Two fingers are dipped into the pot containing
the <i>poi</i>, and turned rapidly round until a sufficient
quantity of the paste adheres to them; then, by
a rapid motion, the lot is wriggled out of the pot, conveyed
into the mouth, and the fingers are sucked clean.
Young girls dip in only one finger at a time, the men
two fingers. I was frequently invited to dip my fingers
into the <i>poi</i> and try it, being told that it was very
good; but I had not the courage.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But to proceed on my walk up the Nuuanu Valley.
About two miles from the town, we came to a very
pretty villa on one side of the road,&mdash;with some large
native huts, in a shady garden, on the other. We
find that this villa is the country residence of Queen
Emma. Looking in through the gate of the garden
opposite, who should I see but our quondam lady
passenger from Sydney, Miss Ribbids, reclining on a
bank in the most luxurious fashion! She had walked
up the valley alone, she informed us, and the natives
had been most kind to her, giving her fruits, and
wreaths of flowers for her adornment.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the valley, we find ourselves on high
ground, our road having been for the most part up-hill.
Looking back, a charming view lies spread before us.
The sky is brilliant and unclouded. Below us lie the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
town and harbour, the blue sea as smooth as a mirror,
shipping dotting the bay, and a silvery line of water
breaking along the distant reef. We begin to catch
the breeze blowing from the upper part of the valley,
and it feels fresh and invigorating after toiling under
the noonday sun.</p>

<p>As we ascend the road we meet several of the native
girls coming down on horseback. They seem to have
quite a passion for riding in the island, and have often
to be prevented racing through the streets of Honolulu.
The horses are of a poor breed; but the women, who
sit astride like the men, seem plucky riders, their
long, flowing dresses making respectable riding-habits.
Most of the girls wore garlands of <i>ohelo</i> and other
flowers round their heads, being very fond of ornament.</p>

<p>Shortly after meeting the girls, a man passed us, at
the usual jog canter, with a coffin slung on the saddle
in front of him, and after him followed another rider
with the lid. We remarked upon the strange burden,
and I asked of the first man, who was going to be
buried? "My wife," he replied; "me pay seventy-five
dollars for um coffin." He grinned, and seemed
quite pleased with his coffin, which was really a handsome
one.</p>

<p>As we ascend, we seem to get quite into the bush.
Thick vegetation spreads up the steep hills on each
side of us. I can now understand how difficult it must
be to travel through a tropical forest. The brushwood
grows so close together, and is so intertwined, that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
would appear almost impossible to force one's way
through it. The mountains rise higher and higher as
we advance, and are covered with lovely light-green
foliage. The hills seem to have been thrown up evenly
in ridges, each ridge running up the mountain-side
having its separate peak. Here and there a small
cataract leaps down the face of a rock, shining like a
silver thread, and disappearing in the brushwood below
until it comes down to swell the mountain-torrent
running by our side close to the road.</p>

<p>At a turn of the road, we suddenly encountered a
number of men coming down from some cattle ranches
in the hills, mounted <i>&agrave; la Mexicaine</i>, with lassoes on
their saddles and heavy whips in their hands, driving
before them a few miserable cattle. There seemed to
be about eighteen men to a dozen small beasts. I guess
that a couple of Australian stockmen, with their whips,
could easily have driven before them the whole lot&mdash;men,
horses, and cattle.</p>

<p>We were now about seven miles from Honolulu, and
very near the end of our up-hill journey. After walking
up a steeper ascent than usual, the scenery becoming
even more romantic and picturesque, we pass through
a thicket of hibiscus and other trees, when suddenly,
on turning round a small pile of volcanic rocks, we
emerge on an open space, and the grand precipice or
Pali, of the Nuuanu Valley bursts upon us with startling
effect.</p>

<p>Here, in some tremendous convulsion of Nature, the
mountain-ridge seems to have been suddenly rent and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
burst through towards its summit, and we look down
over a precipice some five hundred feet deep. It is
possible to wind down the face of the rock by a narrow
path; but, having no mind to make the descent, we
rest and admire the magnificent prospect before and
below us. Under the precipice is a forest, so near to
the foot of the rock that one might easily pitch a stone
into it. Over the forest stretches a lovely country,
green and fresh, dotted with hills and woods. The sea,
about seven miles off, bounds the view, with its silver
line of breakers on the outer reef. The long line of
white looks beautiful on the calm blue sea, with the
sun shining on it. The country before us did not seem
to be much cultivated. Here and there, below us, a
native hut might be discerned amidst the trees, but no
large dwelling or village was in sight.</p>

<p>The rent in the mountain, through which we have
passed, is torn and rugged. Immense masses of black
rock, several hundred feet in height, and nearly perpendicular,
form the two sides of the rift. On one side,
the mountain seems to rise straight up into the air,
until it is lost in a white cloud; on the other, the rock
is equally precipitous, but not quite so high. From
this last the range stretches away in a semicircle,
ending along the coast some twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>A few more words about the natives, whom I have
as yet only incidentally alluded to. Of course, I saw a
good deal of them, in one way or another, during my
brief stay at Honolulu. We had scarcely got alongside
the wharf, ere the Kanakas&mdash;as they are called&mdash;came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
aboard, popping their heads in and out of the
cabins, some selling bananas and oranges, others offering
coral and curiosities, but most of them to examine the
ship out of mere curiosity. From what I observed, I
should say that the Kanakas are of the same stock as
the Maoris, not so much tattoo-marked, much more
peacefully inclined, and probably more industrious.
Some of the men are tall and handsome, which is more
than I can say of the women. The men do not work
very heartily on day wages, but well enough when paid
by the piece. Here, on the wharf, they get a dollar for
a day's work, and a dollar-and-a-half for night-work.
They are employed in filling the coal-bunkers and
unloading the ship.</p>

<p>The Kanakas are capital divers, and work almost
as well in the water as out of it. I saw one of them
engaged in repairing the bottom of the 'Moses Taylor,'
by which I am to sail for San Francisco. He is paid
three dollars for a general inspection, or five dollars
for a day's work. I saw him go down to nail a piece
of copper-sheathing on the bottom, where it had been
damaged in grounding upon a rock, when last coming
out of San Francisco harbour. He took down about
thirty copper nails in his mouth, with the hammer and
sheet of copper in his hand, coming up to breathe
after each nail was knocked in. I could hear the loud
knocking as he drove the nails into the ship's side.
At the same time, some Kanaka boys were playing
about in the water near at hand, diving for stones or
bits of money. The piece was never allowed to sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
more than a few feet before a boy was down after it
and secured it. They never missed the smallest silver-bit.
It seemed to me as if some of them could swim
before they could walk.</p>

<p>As for the women, although travellers have spread
abroad reports of their beauty, I was unable to see it.
While the 'Moses Taylor' lay in the harbour, the saloon
was sometimes full of native girls, who came down
from the country to see the ship and admire themselves
in the two large saloon mirrors, before which they
stood laughing and giggling. Their usual dress consists
of a long, loose gown, reaching down to the ancles,
with no fastening round the waist; and their heads and
necks are usually adorned with leaves or flowers of
some sort. They seem to me very like the Maori
women, but without the blue tattoo-mark on the lips;
nor are their features so strongly marked, though they
had the same wide faces, black eyes, full nostrils, and
large lips. Their skins are of various hues, from a
yellow to a dusky-brown. Their feet and hands are
usually small and neat.</p>

<p>I am told that the race is degenerating and dying
out fast. The population of the islands is said to be
little more than one-tenth of what it was when Captain
Cook visited them; and this falling off is reported to be
mainly due to the unchaste habits of the women. The
missionaries have long been trying to make a salutary
impression on them; but, though the natives profess
Christianity in various forms, it is to be feared that it is
a profession, and little more. The King, also, has tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to make them more moral, by putting in force a sort
of Maine liquor-law; but every ship that enters the
harbour is beset by natives wanting drink, and they
adopt various methods of evading the law. The licence
charged by the Government to a retailer of spirits is
a thousand dollars a year; but he must not sell liquor
to any foreigner on a Sunday, nor to any native at any
time, under a penalty of five hundred dollars. This
penalty is rigidly exacted; and if the spirit-dealer is
unable to pay the fine, he is put on the coral-reefs,
to work at twenty-five cents a day until he has worked
off the amount. Accordingly, the liquor-trade is followed
by very few persons, and the consumption of
drink by the natives is very much curtailed,&mdash;compared,
for instance, with what it is among the drink-consuming
natives of New Zealand, who are allowed
to swallow the "fire-water," to the great profit of the
publicans and to their own demoralization, without any
restriction whatever.</p>

<p>I find the Government here also levies a very considerable
sum from the Chinese, for the privilege of
selling opium. It is put up annually to auction, and
in some years as much as forty-five thousand dollars
have been paid for the monopoly, though this year it
has brought considerably less in consequence of the
dulness of trade. From this circumstance it will be
inferred that there is a considerable Chinese population
in the place. Indeed, some of the finest stores in
Honolulu are kept by Chinamen. I did not at first
observe many of these people about; but afterwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
when exploring, I found whole back-streets full of
Chinamen's huts and houses.</p>

<p>From the announcements of theatrical and other
entertainments I see about, the people here must be
very fond of amusement. Indeed, Honolulu seems to
be one of the great centres of pleasure in the Pacific.
All wandering "stars" come hither. When I was at
Auckland, in New Zealand, I went to the theatre to
see a troupe of Japanese jugglers. I had seen the
identical troupe in London, and "All Right" was
amongst them. They were on their way to Honolulu,
to star it here before returning to Japan. Charles
Mathews, with whom I made the voyage from Melbourne
to Sydney, is also advertised to appear, "for
a few nights only," at the Royal Hawaiian Theatre.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
And now here is The Bandman, my fellow-passenger
from Auckland, advertised, in big placards, as "The
World-renowned Shaksperian Player," &amp;c., who is about
to give a series of such and such representations at the
same place.</p>

<p>Beautiful though the island of Oahu may be, I soon
found that I could not live there. Even in winter it was
like living in a hothouse. The air was steamy with
heat, and frightfully relaxing. At intervals my nose
streamed with blood, and I grew sensibly thinner.
Then I suffered terribly from the musquitoes; my ankles
were quite swollen with their bites, and in a day or
two more I should have been dead-lame. There are,
besides, other tormentors&mdash;small flies, very like the
Victorian sand-flies, that give one a nasty sting. I
was very glad, therefore, after four days' stay at Honolulu,
to learn that the 'Moses Taylor' was ready to
sail for San Francisco.</p>

</p><p>
"At Honolulu, one of the loveliest
little spots upon earth, I acted
one night 'by command, and in
the presence of his Majesty Kamehameha
V., King of the Sandwich
Islands' (not 'Hoky Poky
Wonky Fong,' as erroneously reported),
and a memorable night it
was. On my way to the quaint
little Hawaiian Theatre, situated
in a rural lane, in the midst of a
pretty garden, glowing with gaudy
tropical flowers, and shaded by
cocoa-trees, bananas, banyans, and
tamarinds, I met the playbill of
the evening. A perambulating
Kanaka (or native black gentleman),
walking between two boards
(called in London, figuratively, 'a
sandwich man,' but here, of course
literally so), carried aloft a large
illuminated white lantern, with
the announcement in the Kanaka
language to catch the attention of
the coloured inhabitants: 'Charles
Mathews; Keaka Keia Po (Theatre
open this evening). Ka uku
o Ke Komo ana (reserved seats,
dress circle), $2.50; Nohi mua
(Parquette), $1; Noho ho (Kanaka
pit), 75c.' I found the theatre
(to use the technical expression)
'crammed to suffocation,' which
merely means 'very full,' though
from the state of the thermometer
on this occasion, 'suffocation' was
not so incorrect a description as
usual. A really elegant-looking
audience (tickets 10<i>s.</i> each), evening
dresses, uniforms of every cut
and every country. 'Chieftesses'
and ladies of every tinge, in
dresses of every colour, flowers and
jewels in profusion, satin playbills,
fans going, windows and doors all
open, an outside staircase leading
straight into the dress circle,
without lobby, check-taker, or
money-taker. Kanaka women in
the garden below selling bananas
and pea-nuts by the glare of flaring
torches on a sultry tropical moonlight
night. The whole thing was
like nothing but a midsummer-night's
dream. And was it nothing
to see a pit full of Kanakas, black,
brown, and whitey-brown (till
lately cannibals), showing their
white teeth, grinning and enjoying
'Patter <i>v.</i> Clatter' as much as a
few years ago they would have
enjoyed the roasting of a missionary
or the baking of a baby? It
was certainly a page in one's life
never to be forgotten."</p></div>

Gate</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Close of the Pacific Log</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">First Sight of America</span>.</p>


<p>The departure of the 'Moses Taylor' was evidently
regarded as a great event at Honolulu. At the hour
appointed for our sailing, a great crowd had assembled
on the wharf. All the notabilities of the place seemed
to be there. First and foremost was the King of the
Sandwich Islands himself, Kamehameha V.&mdash;a jolly-looking,
portly old fellow, standing about six feet high,
and weighing over five-and-twenty stone&mdash;every inch
and ounce a king. Then there were the chief ministers
of his court, white, yellow, and dusky. There
were also English, Americans, and Chinese, with a
crowd of full-blooded Kanakas&mdash;all very orderly and
admiring. And round the outskirts of the throng were
several carriages filled with native ladies.</p>

<p>Punctually at half-past 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, we got away from
our moorings, with "three cheers for Honolulu," which
were raised by a shipwrecked crew we had on board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Leaving the pier, we shortly passed through the opening
in the reef which forms the entrance to the harbour,
and steamed steadily eastward in the direction of San
Francisco.</p>

<p>I must explain how it was that the "three cheers
for Honolulu" were raised. The 'Saginaw' was an
American war-ship that had been sent with a contract
party to Midway Island in the North Pacific&mdash;some
fifteen hundred miles west-north-west of the Sandwich
Islands&mdash;to blast the coral-reef there, in order to
provide a harbourage for the line of large steamers
running between San Francisco and China. The
money voted for the purpose by the Government
having been spent, the 'Saginaw' was on its return
voyage from the island, when the captain determined
to call at Ocean Island to see if there were any shipwrecked
crews there; but in a fog, the ship ran upon
a coral-reef, and was itself wrecked. The men, to
the number of ninety-three, contrived to reach the
island, where they remained sixty-nine days, during
which they lived mostly on seal meat and the few
stores they had been able to save from their ship. The
island itself is entirely barren, containing only a few
bushes and a sort of dry grass, with millions of rats&mdash;supposed
to have bred from rats landed from shipwrecked
vessels. Strict military discipline was preserved
by the officers, and the men as a body behaved
remarkably well.</p>

<p>At length, no vessel appearing in sight, four of the
sailors volunteered to row in an open boat to the Sandwich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Islands&mdash;more than a thousand miles distant&mdash;for
the purpose of reporting the wreck of the ship, and sending
relief to those on the island. The boat departed,
reached the reef which surrounds Kauai, an island to
the north-west of Oahu, and was there wrecked, only
one of the men succeeding in reaching the shore.
So soon as the intelligence of the wreck of the 'Saginaw'
reached Honolulu, the Government immediately dispatched
a steamer to take the men off the desert
island; and hence the enthusiastic cheers for Honolulu,
raised by the rescued officers and men of the American
ship, who are now all on board the 'Moses Taylor,' on
their way back to San Francisco.</p>

<p>I must now describe my new ship. She is called
the 'Rolling Moses;' but with what justice I am as
yet unable to say. She certainly looks singularly top-hampered,&mdash;altogether
unlike any British ship that I
have ever seen. She measures twice as much in the
beam as the 'City of Melbourne;' is about 2000 tons
register; is flat-bottomed, and draws about fourteen
feet of water when laden. She looks like a great big
house afloat, or rather a row of houses more than thirty
feet high. The decks seemed piled one a-top of the
other, quite promiscuously. First there is the dining-saloon,
with cabins all round it; above is the drawing-room,
with more cabins; then above that is the
hurricane deck, with numerous deck-houses for the captain
and officers; and then, towering above all, there
is the large beam-engine right between the paddle-boxes.
Altogether it looks a very unwieldy affair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
I would certainly much rather trust myself to such a
ship as the 'City of Melbourne.' It strikes me that
in a heavy sea, 'Moses's' hull would run some risk of
parting company with the immense structure above.</p>

<p>The cabin accommodation is, however, greatly superior
to that of my late ship,&mdash;there is so much more room,
and the whole arrangements for the comfort of the
passengers are all that could be desired. The Americans
certainly do seem to understand comfort in travelling.
The stewards and people about are civil and obliging,
and don't seem to be always looking for a "tip," as is
so customary on board an English boat. This ship also
is cleaner than the one I have left&mdash;there are none of
those hideous smells that so disgusted me on board
'The City.' The meals are better, and there is much
greater variety&mdash;lots of different little dishes&mdash;of meat,
stews, mashed potatoes, squashes, hominy or corn-cake,
and such like. So far as the living goes, therefore,
I think I shall get on very well on board the
'Moses Taylor.'</p>

<p>The weather is wet and what sailors call "dirty,"
and it grows sensibly colder. As there is no pleasure
in remaining on deck, I keep for the most part below. I
like my company very much&mdash;mostly consisting of the
shipwrecked men of the 'Saginaw.' They are nice,
lively fellows; they encourage me to talk, and we
have many a hearty laugh together. Some of them
give me no end of yarns about the late war, in which
they were engaged; and they tell me (whether true
or not, I have no means of knowing), that the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of the ship we are in was first lieutenant of the
"pirate" ship 'Florida.' I have not found amongst
my companions as yet any of that self-assertion or
pride of nationality said to distinguish the Yankee;
nor have I heard a word from them of hostility to
John Bull. Indeed, for the purpose of drawing them
out, I began bragging a little about England, but they
let me have my own way without contradiction. They
say nothing about politics, or, if they allude to the
subject, express very moderate opinions. Altogether,
I get on with them; and like them very much.</p>

<p>The 'Moses Taylor' proves a steadier sea-boat than I
expected from her built-up appearance. She certainly
gives many a long steady roll; but there is little pitching
or tossing. When the sea strikes her, she quivers
all over in a rather uncomfortable way. She is rather
an old ship; she formerly ran between Vancouver and
San Francisco, and is certainly the worse for wear. The
huge engine-shafts shake the beams which support
them; the pieces of timber tremble under the heavy
strokes of the engine, and considerable apertures open
from time to time in the deck as she heaves to and fro.
The weather, however, is not stormy; and the ship will
doubtless carry us safely to the end of our voyage,&mdash;going
steadily, as she does, at the rate of about eight
knots an hour. And as the distance between Honolulu
and the American coast is about 2100 miles, we shall
probably make the voyage in about ten days.</p>

<p>On the eighth day after leaving Honolulu, an incident
occurred which made a startling impression on me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
While we were laughing and talking in the cabin&mdash;kept
down there by the rain&mdash;we were told that a poor
man, who had been ailing since we left port, had
breathed his last. It seemed that he had some affection
of the gullet which prevented his swallowing food.
The surgeon on board did not possess the necessary
instrument to enable him to introduce food into his
stomach, so that he literally died of starvation. He
occupied the berth exactly opposite mine, and though
I knew he was ill, I had no idea that his end was so
near. He himself; however, had been aware of it, and
anxiously wished that he might survive until he reached
San Francisco, where his wife was to meet him at
the landing. But it was not to be; and his sudden
decease gave us all a great shock.</p>

<p>We had our breakfast and dinner that day whilst
the body was lying in the cabin. We heard the carpenter
busy on the main deck knocking together a
coffin for its reception. Every time he knocked a
nail in, I thought of the poor dead fellow who lay
beside us. I began to speculate as to the various
feelings with which passengers land in a new place.
Some are mere passing visitors like myself, bent on
seeing novel sights; some are going thither, full of
hope, to make a new settlement in life; some are returning
home, expecting old friends waiting on the pier-head
to meet and welcome them. But there are sad
meetings, too; and here there will be an anxious wife
waiting at the landing-place, only to receive the dead
body of her husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>But a truce to moralizing; for we are approaching
the Golden Gate. I must now pack up my
things, and finish my log. I have stuck to it at all
hours and in all weathers; jotted down little bits from
time to time in the intervals of sea-sickness, toothache,
and tic douloureux; written under a burning tropical
sun, and amidst the drizzle and down-pour of the North
Pacific; but I have found pleasure in keeping it up,
because I know that it will be read with pleasure by
those for whom it is written, and it will serve to show
that amidst all my wanderings, I have never forgotten
the Old Folks at Home.</p>

<p>At half-past four on the morning of the tenth day
from our leaving Honolulu, we sighted the lighthouse
at the Golden Gate, which forms the entrance to the
spacious bay or harbour of San Francisco. Suddenly,
there is a great scampering about of the passengers, a
general packing up of baggage; a brushing of boots,
hats, and clothes; and a dressing up in shore-going
"togs." The steward comes round to look after his
perquisites, and every one is in a bustle about something
or other.</p>

<p>I took a last rest in my bunk&mdash;for it was still early
morning&mdash;until I was told that we were close along-shore;
and then I jumped up, went on deck, and saw
America for the first time.</p>

Sacramento</span>.</p>


<p>We have passed in from the Pacific through the
Golden Gate, swung round towards the south, and
then, along the eastern margin of the peninsula which
runs up to form the bay, the City of San Francisco lies
before me! A great mass of houses and warehouses,
fronted by a long line of wharves, extends along the
water's edge. Masses of houses, tipped with occasional
towers and spires, rise up on the high ground behind,
crowning the summits of Telegraph, Russian, and Clay
Street Hills.</p>

<p>But we have little time to take note of the external
features of the city, for we are already alongside the
pier. Long before the gangways can be run out and
laid between the ship and the wharf, there is a rush of
hotel runners on board, calling out the names of their
respective hotels and distributing their cards. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
is a tremendous hurry-scurry. The touters make
dashes at the baggage and carry it off, sometimes in
different directions, each hoping to secure a customer
for his hotel. Thus, in a very few minutes, the ship
was cleared; all the passengers were bowling along
towards their several destinations; and in a few
minutes I found myself safely deposited in "The
Brooklyn," a fine large hotel in Bush Street, situated
in the business part of the town, with dwellings interspersed
amongst the business houses.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to describe San Francisco.
Travellers have done that over and over again.
Indeed, there is not so much about it that is of any
great interest except to business men. One part of
the city is very like another. I was told that some
of the finest buildings were of the Italian order; but I
should say that by far the greater number were of the
Ramshackle order. Although the first house in the
place was only built in 1835, the streets nearest to the
wharves look already old and worn out. They are
for the most part of wood, and their paint is covered
with dirt. But though prematurely old, they are by
no means picturesque. Of course, in so large a place,
with a population of 150,000, and already so rich and
prosperous, though so young, there are many fine
buildings and some fine streets. The hotels carry
away the palm as yet,&mdash;the Grand Hotel at the corner
of Market and New Montgomery Streets being the
finest. There are also churches, theatres, hospitals,
markets, and all the other appurtenances of a great city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>I had not for a long time seen such a bustle of
traffic as presented itself in the streets of San Francisco.
The whole place seemed to be alive. Foot passengers
jostled each other; drays and waggons were rolling
about; business men were clustered together in some
streets, apparently "on change;" with all the accompaniments
of noise, and bustle, and turmoil of a city
full of life and traffic. The money brokers' shops are
very numerous in the two finest streets&mdash;Montgomery
and California Streets. Nearly every other shop there
belongs to a money broker or money changer. Strange
to see the piles of glistening gold in the windows&mdash;ten
to twenty dollar pieces, and heaps of greenbacks.</p>

<p>John Chinaman is here, I see, in great force. There
are said to be as many as 30,000 in the city and
neighbourhood. I wonder these people do not breed a
plague. I went through their quarter one evening,
and was surprised and disgusted with what I saw.
Chinese men and women of the lowest class were swarming
in their narrow alleys. Looking down into small
cellars, I saw from ten to fifteen men and women living
in places which two white men would not sleep in.
The adjoining streets smelt most abominably. The
street I went through must be one of the worst; and I
was afterwards told that it was "dangerous" to pass
through it. I observed a large wooden screen at each
end of it, as if for the purpose of shutting it off from
the white people's quarter.</p>

<p>One of the nuisances we had to encounter in the
streets was that of railway touters. No sooner did we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
emerge from the hotel door, than men lying in wait
pounced upon us, offering tickets by this route, that
route, and the other route to New York. I must have
had a very "new chum" sort of look, for I was accosted
no less than three times one evening by different
touting gentlemen. One wished to know if I had
come from Sydney, expressing his admiration of
Australia generally. Another asked if I was "going
East," offering to sell me a through ticket at a reduced
price. The third also introduced the Sydney topic,
telling me, by way of inducement to buy a ticket of
him, that he had "worked there." I shook them all
off, knowing them to be dangerous customers. I heard
some strange stories of young fellows making friends
with such strangers, and having drinks with them.
The drink is drugged, and the Sydney swell, on his
way to New York, finds himself next morning in the
streets, minus purse, watch, and everything of value
about him.</p>

<p>There is only one railway route as yet across
the Rocky Mountains, by the Western, Central, and
Union Pacific, as far as Omaha; but from that point
there are various lines to New York, and it was to
secure passengers by these respective routes that the
touters were so busily at work. All the hotels, bars,
and stores, are full of their advertisements:&mdash;"The
Shortest Route to the East"&mdash;"Pullman's Palace Cars
Run on this Line"&mdash;"The Route of all Nations"&mdash;"The
Grand Route, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Niagara," such are a few
specimens of these urgent announcements. I decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to select the route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Chicago, Detroit, Niagara, and
down the Hudson river to New York; and made my
arrangements accordingly.</p>

</a><span class="caption">(Map of Atlantic and Pacific Railways) <i>Reduced from

</p>

<p>I left San Francisco on the morning of the 8th of
February. The weather was cold compared with that
of the Sandwich Islands; yet there were few signs of
winter. There was no snow on the ground; and at
midday it was agreeable and comparatively mild. I
knew, however, that as soon as we left the shores of
the Pacific, and ascended the western slopes of the
Rocky Mountains, if not before, we should encounter
thorough winter weather, and I prepared myself with
coats and wrappers as a defence from the cold.</p>

<p>My fellow-voyager from New Zealand, the German-American
of whom I have spoken above, and who
seemed to take quite a liking for me, accompanied
me down to the wharf, where we parted with mutual
regret. It was necessary for me to cross the bay by a
ferry-boat to Oakland, where the train is made up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
starts for Sacramento. There was a considerable crowd
round the baggage-office, where I gave up my trunks,
and obtained, in exchange, two small brass checks
which will enable me to reclaim them on the arrival
of the train at Omaha. I proceeded down the pier and
on to the ferry-boat. Indeed, I was on it before I was
aware. It looked so like a part of the wharf, and
was so surrounded by piles and wooden erections, that
I did not know I was on its deck, and was inquiring
about its arrival to take us off, when I found the
huge boat gradually moving away from the pier!</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/image249-lg.png">
<img src="images/image249.png" width="600" height="311" alt="&#39;Westward by Rail.&#39; Longmans. 1871." title="&#39;Westward by Rail.&#39; Longmans. 1871." />
</a><span class="caption">&#39;<i>Westward by Rail</i>.&#39; <i>Longmans</i>. 1871.</span>
</p>

<p>It was a regular American ferry-boat, of the same
build fore and aft, capable of going alike backwards or
forwards, and with a long bridge at each end, ready to
be let down at the piers on either side of the bay, so
as to enable carts or carriages to be driven directly on
to the main deck, which was just like a large covered
yard, standing level with the wharf. Over this was an
upper deck with a nice saloon, where I observed notices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
stuck up of "No spitting allowed;" showing that
there was greater consideration for the ladies here than
there was on board the 'Moses Taylor,' where spittle
and quids were constantly shooting about the decks,
with very little regard for passers-by, whether ladies
or gentlemen.</p>

<p>Steaming away from the pier, we obtained a splendid
view of the city behind us. The wharves along its
front were crowded with shipping of all sorts; amongst
which we could observe the huge American three-decker
river steamers, Clyde-built clippers, brigs,
schooners, and a multitude of smaller craft. Down
the bay we see the green hills rising in the distance,
fading away in the grey of the morning. Close on our
left is a pretty island, about half-way across the bay,
in the centre of which is a green hill,&mdash;what seemed
to Australian eyes good pasture ground; and I could
discern what I took to be a station or farmhouse.</p>

<p>In about an hour we found ourselves nearing the
land on the eastern shore of the bay, where we observe
the railway comes out to meet us. The water on this
side is so shoal for a distance from the shore that no
ships of any considerable burden can float in it, so that
the railway is carried out on piles into the deep water
for a distance of nearly a mile. Here we land, and get
into the train waiting alongside; then the engine
begins to snort, and we are away. As we move off
from the waters of San Francisco Bay, I feel I have
made another long stride on the road towards England.</p>

<p>We continue for some time rolling along the rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
shaky timber pier on which the rails are laid. At last
we reach the dry land, and speed through Oakland&mdash;a
pretty town&mdash;rattling through the streets just like an
omnibus or tramway car, ringing a bell to warn people
of the approach of the cars. We stop at nearly every
station, and the local traffic seems large. Farm land
and nice rolling country stretches away on either side
of the track.</p>

<p>From looking out of the carriage windows, I begin
to take note of the carriage itself&mdash;a real American
railway carriage. It is a long car with a passage down
the middle. On each side of this passage are seats for
two persons, facing the engine; but the backs being
reversible, a party of four can sit as in an English
carriage, face to face. At each end of the carriage is a
stove, and a filter of iced water. The door at each end
leads out on to a platform, enabling the conductor to
walk through the train from one end to the other.</p>

<p>This arrangement for the conductor, by the way, is
rather a nuisance. He comes round six or seven times
during the twenty-four hours, often during the night,
perhaps at a time when you are trying to snatch a few
minutes' nap, and you find your shoulder tapped, and
a bull's-eye turned full upon you, with a demand for
"tickets." This, however, is to be avoided by affixing
a little card in your hat, which the conductor gives
you, so that by inspection he knows at once whether
his passenger is legitimate or not.</p>

<p>I did not travel by one of "Pullman's Silver Palace
Drawing-room Cars," though I examined them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
admired their many comforts. By day they afford
roomy accommodation, with ample space for walking
about, or for playing at cards or chess on the tables
provided for the purpose. At night a double row of
comfortable-looking berths are made up, a curtain
being drawn along the front to render them as
private as may be, and leaving only a narrow passage
along the centre of the car. At the end of the car are
conveniences for washing, iced water, and the never-failing
stove.</p>

<p>The use of the sleeping-cars costs about three or four
dollars extra per night. I avoided this expense, and
contrived a very good substitute in my second-class
car. Fortunately we were not very full of passengers;
and by making use of four seats, or two benches,
turning one of the seat-backs round, and placing the
seat-bottoms lengthwise, I arranged a tolerably good
sleeping-place for the night. But had the carriage
been full, and the occupants been under the necessity
of sitting up during the six days the journey lasted,
I should imagine that it must have become almost
intolerable by the time we reached Omaha.</p>

<p>There were some rather unpleasant fellow-travellers
in my compartment&mdash;several unsavoury Chinamen,
smoking very bad tobacco; and other smoking gentlemen,
who make the second-class compartments their
rendezvous. But for the thorough draught we obtained
from time to time on the passage of the conductor,
the atmosphere would be, as indeed it often was, of a
very disagreeable character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>About forty-two miles from San Francisco, I find
we are already in amongst the hills of a range, and
winding in and out through pretty valleys, where all
available land is used for farming purposes. We round
some curves that look almost impossible, and I begin
to feel the oscillation of the carriages, by no means
unlike the rolling of a ship at sea. I often wished
that it had been summer instead of winter, that I
might better have enjoyed the beauty of the scenery
as we sped along. As it was, I could see that the
country must be very fine under a summer sky. We
have met with no snow at present, being still on the
sunny slopes of the Pacific; nor have we as yet
mounted up to any very high elevation.</p>

<p>We were not long in passing through the range
of hills of which I have spoken, and then we emerged
upon the plains, which continued until we reached
Sacramento, the capital of the State. The only town of
any importance that we have yet passed was Stockton,
a place about midway between San Francisco and
Sacramento, where we now are. Down by the riverside
I see some large lumber-yards, indicative of a
considerable timber trade. The wharves were dirty,
as wharves generally are; but they were busy with
traffic. The town seemed well laid out, in broad
streets; the houses being built widely apart, each with
its garden about it; while long lines of trees run
along most of the streets. Prominent amongst the
buildings is the large new Senate House or Capitol,
a really grand feature of the city. The place having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
been originally built of wood, it has been liable to
conflagrations, which have more than once nearly
destroyed it. Floods have also swept over the valley,
and carried away large portions of the town; but
having been rebuilt on piles ten feet above the original
level, it is now believed to be secure against injury
from this cause.</p>

<p>Sacramento is the terminus of the Western Pacific
Railway, from which the Central Pacific extends east
towards the Rocky Mountains. The railway workshops
of the Company are located here, and occupy
a large extent of ground. They are said to be very
complete and commodious.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers by the train, whom we had
brought on from San Francisco, or picked up along
the road, descended here; and I was very glad to
observe that amongst them were the Chinamen, who
relieved us from their further most disagreeable odour.
After a short stoppage, and rearrangement of the train,
we were off again, toiling up the slopes of the Sierra
Nevada&mdash;the Switzerland of California.</p>

<p>We had now begun the ascent of the difficult mountain
country that separates the Eastern from the Western
States of the Union, and through which the Central
Pacific Railway has been recently constructed and
completed&mdash;one of the greatest railway works of our
time. As we advance, the scenery changes rapidly.
Instead of the flat and comparatively monotonous
country we have for some time been passing through,
we now cross deep gullies, climb up steep ascents, and
traverse lovely valleys. Sometimes we seem to be
enclosed in mountains with an impenetrable barrier
before us. But rushing into a tunnel, we shortly
emerge on the other side, to find ourselves steaming
along the edge of a precipice.</p>

<p>What struck me very much was the apparent slimness
of the trestle-bridges over which we were carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
across the gullies, in the bottom of which mountain
torrents were dashing, some fifty or a hundred feet
below us. My first experience of such a crossing was
quite startling. I was standing on the platform of the
last car, looking back at the fast vanishing scene&mdash;a
winding valley shut in by pine-clad mountains which
we had for some time been ascending,&mdash;when, glancing
down on the track, instead of solid earth, I saw the
ground, through the open timbers of the trestle-bridge,
at least sixty feet below me! The timber road was
only the width of the single iron track; so that any
one looking out of the side carriage-windows would
see sixty feet down into space. The beams on which
the trestle-bridge is supported, are, in some cases,
rested on stone; but oftener they are not. It is not
easy to describe the sensation first felt on rattling over
one of these trembling viaducts, with a lovely view
down some mountain gorge, and then, perhaps, suddenly
plunging into a dark cutting on the other side of the
trestle. But use is everything; and before long I got
quite accustomed to the sensation of looking down
through the open woodwork of the line on to broken
ground and mountain torrents rushing a hundred feet
or more below me.</p>

<p>We left Sacramento at 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and evening was
coming on as we got into the mountains. Still, long
before sunset we saw many traces of large "placers,"
where whole sides of the hills had been dug out and
washed away in the search for gold; the water being
brought over the hill-tops by various ingenious methods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Sometimes, too, we came upon signs of active mining,
in the water-courses led across valleys at levels above
us, consisting of wooden troughs supported on trestles
similar to those we are so frequently crossing. In
one place I saw a party of men busily at work along
the mountain side, preparatory to letting the water in
upon the auriferous ground they were exploring.</p>

<p>I stood for more than two hours on the platform at
the rear of the train, never tired of watching the
wonderful scenery that continually receded from my
gaze,&mdash;sometimes the track suddenly disappearing as
we rounded a curve; and then looking ahead, I would
find that an entirely new prospect was opening into
view.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the lovely scene that evening,
when the golden sun was setting far away on the
Pacific coast. The great red orb sank slowly behind
a low hill at the end of the valley which stretched
away on our right far beneath us. The pine-trees
shone red in the departing sunlight for a short time;
then the warm, dusky glimmer gradually faded away
on the horizon, and all was over. The scene now
looked more dreary, the mountains more rugged, and
everything more desolate than before.</p>

<p>Up we rushed, still ascending the mountain slopes,
winding in and out&mdash;higher and higher&mdash;the mountains
becoming more rugged and wild, and the country more
broken and barren-looking. Crossing slowly another
trestle-bridge seventy-five feet high, at the upper part
of a valley, we rounded a sharp curve, and found ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
on a lofty mountain-side along which the road
is cut, with a deep glen lying 2500 feet below us
wrapped in the shades of evening. It seems to be
quite night down there, and the trees are so shrouded
in gloom that I can scarcely discern them in the
bottom of that awful chasm. I can only clearly see
defined against the sky above me, the rugged masses
of overhanging rock, black-looking and terrible.</p>

<p>I find, on inquiry, that this part of the road is called
"Cape Horn," The bluffs at this point are so precipitous,
that when the railroad was made, the workmen
had to be lowered down the face of the rock by ropes
and held on by men above, until they were enabled to
blast for themselves a foot-hold on the side of the
precipice. We have now ascended to a height of
nearly 3200 feet above the level of the sea; and, as
may be inferred, the night air grows sharp and cold.
As little more can be seen for the present, I am under
the necessity of taking shelter in the car.</p>

<p>At half-past six we stopped for tea at Alta, 207 miles
from San Francisco, at an elevation of 3600 feet above
the sea. Here I had a good meal for a dollar&mdash;the
first since leaving 'Frisco. Had I known of the short
stoppages and the distant refreshing places along the
route, I would certainly have provided myself with a
well-stored luncheon-basket before setting out; but it
is now too late.</p>

<p>After a stoppage of twenty minutes, the big bell
tolled, and we seated ourselves in the cars again; and
away we went as before, still toiling up-hill. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
really climbing now. I can hear it by the strong snorts
of the engine, and see it by the steepness of the track.
I long to be able to see around me, for we are passing
some of the grandest scenery of the line. The stars
are now shining brightly over head, and give light
enough to show the patches of snow lying along
the mountain-sides as we proceed. The snow becomes
more continuous as we mount the ascent, until only the
black rocks and pine-trees stand out in relief against
their white background.</p>

<p>I was contrasting the sharp cold of this mountain
region with the bright summer weather I had left
behind me in Australia only a few weeks ago, and the
much more stifling heat of Honolulu only some ten
days since, when the engine gave one of its loud
whistles, like the blast of a fog-horn, and we plunged
into darkness. Looking through the car window, I
observed that we were passing through a wooden framework&mdash;in
fact a snow-shed, the roof sloping from the
mountain-side, to carry safely over the track the snow
and rocky <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which shoot down from above. I find
there are miles upon miles of these snow-sheds along
our route. At the Summit we pass through the
longest, which is 1700 feet in length.</p>

<p>We reached the Summit at ten minutes to ten,
having ascended 3400 feet in a distance of only thirty-six
miles. We are now over 7000 feet above the level
of the sea, travelling through a lofty mountain region.
In the morning, I was on the warm shores of the
Pacific; and now at night I am amidst the snows of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the Sierras. After passing the Summit, we had some
very tortuous travelling; going very fast during an
hour, but winding in and out, as we did, following the
contour of the hills, I found that we had only gained
seven geographical miles in an hour. We then reached
the "City" of Truckee, principally supported by lumbering.
It is the last place in California, and we shall
very soon be across the State boundary into the territory
of Nevada.</p>

<p>After passing this station, I curled up on my bench,
wrapped myself in my rugs, and had a snatch of sleep.
I was wakened up by the stoppage of the train at the
Reno station, when I shook myself up, and went out to
have a look round me. As I alighted from the train, I
had almost come to the ground through the slipperiness
of the platform, which was coated with ice. It
was a sharp frost, and the ground was covered with
snow. At the end of the platform, the snow was piled
up in a drift about twenty feet high on the top of a
shed outside the station. I find there are two kinds of
snow-sheds,&mdash;one sort used on the plains, with pointed
roofs, from which the snow slides down on either side,
thereby preventing the blocking of the line; the other,
used along the mountain-sides, sloping over the track,
so as to carry the snow-shoots clear over it down into
the valley below.</p>

<p>I soon turned in again, wrapped myself up, and slept
soundly for some hours. When I awoke, it was broad
daylight; the sun was shining in at the car windows;
and on looking out, I saw that we were crossing a broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
plain, with mountains on either side of us. The conductor,
coming through the car, informs us that we
shall soon be at Humboldt, where there will be twenty
minutes' stoppage for breakfast. I find that we are now
422 miles on our way, and that during the night we
have crossed the great sage-covered Nevada Desert,
on which so many travellers left their bones to bleach
in the days of the overland journey to California, but
which is now so rapidly and safely traversed by means
of this railway. The train draws up at Humboldt at
seven in the morning; and on descending, I find a
large, well-appointed refreshment room, with the tables
ready laid; and a tempting array of hot tea and coffee,
bacon, steaks, eggs, and other eatables. "I guess" I
had my full dollar's worth out of that Humboldt
establishment&mdash;a "regular square meal," to quote the
language of the conductor.</p>

<p>We mount again, and are off across the high plains.
The sage-brush is the only vegetation to be seen, interspersed
here and there with large beds of alkali, on
which not even sage-brush will grow. The sage country
extends from Wadsworth to Battle Mount Station, a
distance of about two hundred miles. Only occasionally,
by the river-sides, near the station, small
patches of cultivated land are to be seen; but, generally
speaking, the country is barren, and will ever
remain so. We are still nearly 5000 feet above the
level of the sea. There is no longer any snow on
the ground alongside us, but the mountains within
sight are all covered. Though the day is bright and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
sunshiny, and the inside of the car warm, with the
stove always full of blazing wood or coke, the air
outside is cold, sharp, and nipping.</p>

<p>At Battle Mount&mdash;so called because of a severe
engagement which occurred here some years since
between the Indians and the white settlers&mdash;the plains
begin to narrow, and the mountains to close in again
upon the track. Here I saw for the first time a
number of Shoshonie Indians&mdash;the original natives of
the country&mdash;their faces painted red, and their coarse
black hair hanging down over their shoulders. Their
squaws, who carried their papooses in shawls slung
over their backs, came alongside the train to beg
money from the passengers. The Indian men seemed
to be of a very low type&mdash;not for a moment to be compared
with the splendid Maoris of New Zealand. The
only fine tribe of Indians left, are said to be the Sioux;
and these are fast dying out. In the struggle of races
for life, savages nowhere seem to have the slightest
chance when they come in contact with what are
called "civilized" men. If they are not destroyed by
our diseases or our drink, they are by our weapons.</p>

<p>We are now running along the banks of the sluggish
Humboldt river, up to almost its source in the
mountains near the head of the Great Salt Lake. We
cross the winding river from time to time on trestle-bridges;
and soon we are in amongst the mountains
again, penetrating a gorge, where the track is overhung
by lofty bluffs; and climbing up the heights,
we shortly leave the river, foaming in its bed, far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
beneath us. Steeper and higher rise the sides of the
gorge, until suddenly when we round a curve in the
ca&ntilde;on, I see the Devil's Peak, a large jagged mass
of dark-brown rock, which, rising perpendicularly,
breaks up into many points, the highest towering majestically
above us to a height of 1400 feet above the
level of the track. This is what is called the "Ten
Mile Ca&ntilde;on;" and the bold scenery continues until we
emerge from the top of the gorge. At last we are in
the open sunlight again, and shortly after we draw up
at the Elko station.</p>

<p>We are now evidently drawing near a better peopled
district than that we have lately passed through.
Two heavy stage coaches are drawn up alongside
the track, to take passengers to Hamilton and Treasure
City in the White Pine silver-mining district,
about 126 miles distant. A long team of mules
stand laden with goods, destined for the diggers of
the same district. Elko is "not much of a place,"
though I should not wonder if it is called a "City"
here. It mostly consists of what in Victoria would be
called shanties&mdash;huts built of wood and canvas&mdash;some
of the larger of them being labelled "Saloon," "Eating-house,"
"Drug-store," "Paint-shop," and such like.
If one might judge by the number of people thronging
the drinking-houses, the place may be pronounced
prosperous.</p>

<p>Our course now lies through valleys, which look
more fertile, and are certainly much more pleasant to
pass along than those dreary Nevada plains. The sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
goes down on my second day in the train; as we are
traversing a fine valley with rolling hills on either
side. The ground again becomes thickly covered with
snow, and I find we are again ascending a steepish
grade, rising a thousand feet in a distance of about
ninety miles, where we again reach a total altitude of
6180 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>At six next morning, I found we had reached Ogden
in the territory of Utah. During the night we had
passed "The Great American Desert," extending over
an area of sixty square miles&mdash;an utterly blasted place&mdash;so
that I missed nothing by passing over it wrapped
in sleep and rugs. The country about Ogden is well-cultivated
and pleasant looking. Ogden itself is a
busy place, being the terminus of the Central Pacific
Railroad, and the junction for trains running down to
Salt Lake City. From this point the Union Pacific
commences, and runs eastward as far as Omaha.</p>

<p>I decided not to break the journey by visiting Utah&mdash;about
which so much has already been written&mdash;but
to go straight on to Omaha; and I accordingly
took my place in the train about to start eastward.
Here I encountered quite a new phase of American
railroad society. One of my fellow-passengers was a
quack doctor, who contemplated depositing himself
in the first populous place he came to on the track-side,
for the purpose of picking up some "'tarnal red
cents." A colonel and a corporal in the American
army were on their way home from some post in the
Far West, where they had been to keep the Indians in
order. There were several young commercial travellers,
some lucky men returning from the silver-mines in
Idaho, a steward of one of the Pacific mail steamers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
returning to England, and an iron-moulder with his
wife and child on their way to Chicago.</p>

<p>The train soon started, and for some miles we passed
through a well-cultivated country, divided into fields
and orchards, looking pretty even under the thick
snow, and reminding me of the vales of Kent.
But we very soon left the cultivated land behind us,
and were again in amongst the mountain gorges. I
got out on to the platform to look around me, and,
though the piercing cold rather chilled my pleasure,
I could not help enjoying the wonderful scenery that
we passed through during the next three hours. We
are now entering the Wahsatch Mountains by the
grand chasm called the Devil's Gate. We cross a
trestle-bridge fifty feet above the torrent which boils
beneath; and through the black, frowning rocks that
guard the pass, I catch the last glimpse of the open
sunlit plain below.</p>

<p>We are now within the wild Weber Ca&ntilde;on, and
the scene is changing every moment. On the right, we
pass a most wonderful sight, the Devil's slide. Two
ridges of grey rock stand some ten feet out from the
snow and brushwood; and they run parallel to each
other for about 150 feet, right away up the mountain
side. For a distance of thirty-five miles we run along
the dark, deep cleft, the rocks assuming all sorts of
fantastic shapes; and the river Weber running almost
immediately beneath us, fretting and raging against the
obstacles in its course. Sometimes the valley widens
out a little, but again to force us against a cliff,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
where the road has been hewn out of the solid bluff.
In the ca&ntilde;on we pass a pine-tree standing close to
the track, with a large board hung upon it bearing
the words, "1000 miles from Omaha." It is hence
named the "Thousand Mile Tree." We have all that
long way before us to travel on this Union Pacific
Railway.</p>

<p>At last we emerge from Weber Ca&ntilde;on, and pull up
at Echo City, a small place, chiefly inhabited by railway
employ&eacute;s. We start again, and are soon plunged
amidst red, rocky bluffs, more fantastic than any we
have yet passed. We pass the Mormon fortifications
at a place where a precipitous rock overhangs the
narrowing ca&ntilde;on. Here, on the top of the rock, a
thousand feet above us, are piled huge stones, placed
close to the brink of the precipice: once ready to be
hurled down upon the foes of Mormonism&mdash;the army
sent out against them in 1857. The stones were never
used, and are to be seen there yet. The rocks in the
ca&ntilde;on are of a different colour from those we passed
an hour ago. The shapes that they take are wonderful.
Now I could fancy that I saw a beautiful
cathedral, with spires and windows; then a castle,
battlements and bastions, all complete; and more than
one amphitheatre fit for a C&aelig;sar to have held his sports
in. What could be more striking than these great
ragged masses of red rock, thrown one upon another,
and mounting up so high above us? Such fantastical
and curious shapes the weather-worn stone had taken!
Pillars, columns, domes, arches, followed one another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
in quick succession. Bounding a corner, a huge circle
of rocks comes into sight, rising story upon story.
There, perched upon the top of the rising ground, is
a natural castle, complete with gateway and windows.
Indeed, the hour passed quickly, in spite of the cold, and
I felt myself to have been in fairyland for the time.
The whole seemed to be some wild dream. But dream
it could not be. There was the magnificence of the
solid reality&mdash;pile upon pile of the solid rock frowning
down upon me; great boulders thrown together by
some giant force; perpendicular heights, time-worn
and battered by the elements. All combined to produce
in me a feeling of the utmost wonder and
astonishment.</p>

<p>Emerging from Echo Ca&ntilde;on and the Castle Rocks,
we enter a milder valley, where we crawl over a trestle-bridge
450 feet long and 75 feet high. Shortly after
passing Wahsatch Station, we cross the Aspen Summit
and reach an opener country. Since we left Ogden,
we have, in a distance of ninety-three miles, climbed
an ascent of 2500 feet, and are now in a region of frost
and snow. After another hour's travelling, the character
of the scenery again changes, and it becomes
more rugged and broken. The line crosses the Bear
River on another trestle-bridge 600 feet long; and
following the valley, we then strike across the higher
ground to the head of Ham's Fork, down which we
descend, following the valley as far as Bryan or
Black's Fork, 171 miles from Ogden.</p>

<p>As the day is drawing to a close, I take a last look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
upon the scene outside before turning in for the night.
The sun is setting in the west, illuminating with its
last rays the red sandstone bluffs; the light contrasting
with the deep-blue sky overhead, and presenting a
most novel and beautiful effect. We are now traversing
a rolling desert, sometimes whirling round a
bluff in our rapid descent, or crossing a dry water-course
on trestles, the features of the scenery every
moment changing. Then I would catch a glimpse of
the broken, rolling prairies in the distance, covered
with snow; and anon we were rounding another precipitous
bluff. The red of the sunlight grows dull
against the blue sky, until night gradually wraps
the scene in her mantle of grey. Then the moon
comes out with her silvery light, and reveals new
features of wondrous wildness and beauty. I stood for
hours leaning on the rail of the car, gazing at the
fascinating vision, and was only reminded by the
growing coldness of the night that it was time to re-enter
the car and prepare for my night's rest.</p>

<p>After warming myself by the stove, I arranged my
extemporised couch between the seats as before, but
was wakened up by the conductor, who took from me
a cushion more than was my due; so I had to spend
the rest of the night nodding on a box at the end of
the car. However, even the longest and most comfortless
night will come to an end; and when at last the
morning broke, I went out to ascertain whereabouts we
were. I found that it had snowed heavily during the
night; and we now seemed to be in a much colder and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
more desolate country. The wind felt dreadfully keen
as I stood on the car platform and looked about; the
dry snow whisking up from the track as the train
rushed along. The fine particles somehow got inside
the thickest comforter and wrapper, and penetrated
everywhere. So light and fine were the particles that
they seemed to be like thick hoar-frost blowing through
the air.</p>

<p>We have, I observe, a snow-plough fixed on the front
of the engine; and, from the look of the weather, it
would appear as if we should have abundant use for it
yet. Snow-fences and snow-sheds are numerous along
the line we are traversing, for the purpose of preventing
the cuts being drifted up by the snow. At first, I
could not quite make out the nature of these fences,
standing about ten yards from the track, and in some
parts extending for miles. They are constructed of
woodwork, and are so made as to be capable of being
moved from place to place, according as the snow falls
thick or is drifting. That is where the road is on a
level, with perhaps an opening amidst the rolling hills
on one side or the other; but when we pass through
a cutting we are protected by a snow-shed, usually
built of boards supported on poles.</p>

<p>At Laramie City, we stop for breakfast. The name
of "City" is given to several little collections of
houses along the line. I observe that the writer of
the 'Trans-Continental Guide-book' goes almost into
fits when describing the glories of these "Cities,"
which, when we come up to them, prove to be little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
more than so many clusters of sheds. I was not, therefore,
prepared to expect much from the City of
Laramie; and the more so as I knew that but a few
years since the original Fort Laramie consisted of
only a quadrangular enclosure inhabited by trappers,
who had established it for trading purposes with
the Indians. I was accordingly somewhat surprised to
find that the modern Laramie had suddenly shot up
into a place of some population and importance. The
streets are broad and well laid out; the houses are
numerous, and some of them large and substantial.
The place is already provided with schools, hotels,
banks, and a newspaper. The Railway Company have
some good substantial shops here, built of stone; and
they have also provided a very commodious hospital
for the use of their employ&eacute;s when injured or sick&mdash;an
example that might be followed with advantage in
places of even greater importance.</p>

<p>After a stoppage of about half an hour, we were again
careering up-hill past Fort Saunders and the Red
Buttes, the latter so-called from the bold red sandstone
bluffs, in some places a thousand feet high, which bound
the track on our right. Then still up-hill to Harney,
beyond which we cross Dale Creek Bridge&mdash;a wonderful
structure, 650 feet long and 126 feet high, spanning
the creek from bluff to bluff. Looking down through
the interstices of the wooden road, what a distance the
thread of water in the hollow seemed to be below us!</p>

<p>At Sherman, some two hours from Laramie, we
arrived at the Summit of the Rocky Mountain ridge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
where we reached the altitude of about 8400 feet above
the sea-level. Of course it was very cold, hill and
dale being covered with snow as far as the eye could
reach. Now we rush rapidly down-hill, the brakes
screwed tightly down, the cars whizzing round the
curves, and making the snow fly past in clouds. We
have now crossed the backbone of the continent, and
are speeding on towards the settled and populous
country in the East.</p>

<p>At Cheyenne, we have another stoppage for refreshment.
This is one of the cities with which our guidebook
writer falls into ecstasies. It is "The Magic
City of the Plains"&mdash;a place of which it "requires
neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet to enumerate
its resources or predict its future!" Yet Cheyenne is
already a place of importance, and likely to become
still more so,&mdash;being situated at the junction with the
line to Denver, which runs along the rich and lovely
valley of the Colorado. Its population of 8000 seems
very large for a place that so short a time ago was
merely the haunt of Red Indians. Already it has
manufactures, warehouses, wharves, and stores of considerable
magnitude; with all the usual appurtenances
of a place of traffic and business.</p>

<p>Before leaving Cheyenne, I invested in some hung
buffalo steak for consumption at intervals between meals.
It is rather tough and salt,&mdash;something like Hamburg
beef; but seasoned with hunger, and with the appetite
sharpened by the cold and frost of these high regions,
the hung buffalo proved useful and nutritious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>For several hundred miles, our track lay across the
prairie&mdash;monotonous, and comparatively uninteresting
now, in its covering of white&mdash;but in early summer
clad in lively green and carpeted with flowers. I read
that this fine cultivable well-watered country extends
seven hundred miles north and south, along the eastern
base of the Rocky Mountains, with an average width
of two hundred miles. It is said to be amongst the
finest grazing land in the world, with pasturage for
millions of cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>Shortly after passing Antelope Station, the track
skirts the "Prairie Dog City," which I knew at once
by its singular appearance. It consists of hundreds of
little mounds of soil, raised about a foot and a half
from the ground. There were, however, no dogs about
at the time. The biting cold had doubtless sent them
within doors. Indeed, I saw no wild animals on my
journey across the continent, excepting only some black
antelopes with white faces, that I saw on the plains
near this Prairie Dog City.</p>

<p>For a distance of more than five hundred miles&mdash;from
leaving Cheyenne until our arrival in Omaha&mdash;the
railway held along the left bank of the Lodge
Pole Creek, then along the South Fork or Platte
river, and finally along the main Platte river down to
near its junction with the Missouri. When I went to
sleep on the night of the 11th of February&mdash;my fourth
night in the railway train&mdash;we were travelling through
the level prairie; and when I woke up on the following
morning, I found we were on the prairie still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>At seven in the morning, we halted at the station of
Grand Island&mdash;so called from the largest island in the
Platte river, near at hand. Here I had breakfast, and
a good wash in ice-cold water. Although the snow is
heavier than ever, the climate seems already milder.
Yet it is very different indeed from the sweltering heat
of Honolulu only some twelve days ago. At about
10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we bid adieu to the uninhabited prairie&mdash;though
doubtless before many years are over, it will be
covered with farms and homesteads&mdash;and approached
the fringe of the settled country; patches of cultivated
land and the log huts of the settlers beginning to show
themselves here and there alongside the track.</p>

<p>Some eighty miles from Omaha, we cross the north
fork of the Platte river over one of the usual long
timber bridges on piles,&mdash;and continue to skirt the
north bank of the Great Platte,&mdash;certainly a very
remarkable river, being in some places three-quarters
of a mile broad, with an average depth of only six
inches! At length, on the afternoon of the fifth day,
the engine gives a low whistle, and we find ourselves
gliding into the station at Omaha.</p>

<p>I have not much to tell about Omaha, for I did not
make any long stay in the place, being anxious to get
on and finish my journey. It was now my fifth day in
the train, having come a distance of 1912 miles from
San Francisco; and I had still another twenty-four
hours' travel before me to Chicago. There was nothing
to detain me in Omaha. It is like all places suddenly
made by railway, full of bustle and business, but by
no means picturesque. How can it be? The city is
only seventeen years old. Its principal buildings are
manufactories, breweries, warehouses, and hotels.</p>

<p>Omaha has been made by the fact of its having
been fixed upon as the terminus of the Union Pacific
Railroad, and by its convenient position on the great
Missouri river. It occupies a sloping upland on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
right bank, about fifty feet above the level of the
stream; and behind it stretches the great Prairie
country we have just traversed. On the opposite bank
of the Missouri stands Council Bluffs, from which
various railroad lines diverge north, south, and east,
to all parts of the Union. It is probable, therefore,
that before many years have passed, big though Omaha
may now be&mdash;and it already contains 20,000 inhabitants&mdash;the
advantages of its position will tend greatly to
swell its population, and perhaps to render it in course
of time one of the biggest cities of the West.</p>

<span class="caption">(Map of Atlantic and Pacific Railways) <i>Reduced from

</p>

<p>Having arranged to proceed onwards to Chicago by
the North-Western line, I gave up my baggage in
exchange for the usual check, and took my place
in the train. We rolled down a steepish incline, on
to the "mighty Missouri," which we crossed upon a
bridge of boats. I should not have known that I was
upon a deep and rapid river, but for the huge flat-bottomed
boats that I saw lying frozen in along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
banks. It was easy to mistake the enormous breadth
of ice for a wide field covered with snow. As we
proceeded across we met numbers of sledges, coaches,
and omnibuses driving over the ice along a track made
in the deep snow not far from our bridge.</p>

</a><span class="caption">&#39;<i>Westward by Rail</i>.&#39; <i>Longmans</i>. 1871.</span>
</p>

<p>After passing through Council Bluffs, we soon lost
sight of the town and its suburbs, and were again in
the country. But how different the prospect from the
car window, compared with the bare and unsettled
prairies which we had traversed for so many hundred
miles west of Omaha! Now, thick woods extend on
both sides of the track, with an occasional cleared
space for a township, where we stop to take up and set
down passengers. But I shall not proceed further with
my description of winter scenery as viewed from a
passing railway train. Indeed, I fear that my descriptions
heretofore, though rapid, must be felt somewhat
monotonous, for which I crave the reader's forgiveness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>I spent my fifth night in the train pretty comfortably,
having contrived to makeup a tolerable berth. Shortly
after I awoke, we crossed the Mississippi on a splendid
bridge at Fulton. What a noble river it is! Here,
where it must be fifteen hundred miles from its mouth,
it seemed to me not less than a mile across. Like the
Missouri, however, it is now completely frozen over
and covered with thick snow.</p>

<p>We are again passing through a prairie country, the
fertile land of upper Illinois, all well settled and cultivated.
We pass a succession of fine farms and farmsteads.
The fields are divided by rail fences; and in
some places stalks of maize peep up through the snow.
The pretty wooden houses are occasionally half hidden
by the snow-laden trees amidst which they stand.
These Illinois clusters of country-houses remind one
very much of England, they look so snug and homelike;
and they occupy a gently undulating country,&mdash;lovely,
no doubt, in summer time. But the small
towns we passed could never be mistaken for English.
They are laid out quite regularly, each house with
its little garden surrounding it; the broad streets being
planted with avenues of trees.</p>

<p>The snow is lying very heavy on the ground; and
there are drifts we pass through full twenty feet deep
on either side the road. But the day is fine, the sky
is clear and blue, the sun shines brightly, and the
whole scene looks much more cheerful than the Rocky
Mountain region in the west.</p>

<p>Very shortly, evidences appear of our approach to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a considerable place. In fact, we are nearing Chicago.
But long before we reach it, we pass a succession of
pretty villas and country-houses, quite in the English
suburban style, with gardens, shrubberies, and hothouses.
These are the residences of the Chicago
merchants. The houses become more numerous, and
before long we are crossing streets and thoroughfares,
the engine snorting slowly along, and the great bell
ringing to warn all foot-passengers off the track.</p>

<p>What an immense smoky place we have entered:
so different from the pure snow-white prairie country
we have passed. It looks just like another Manchester.
But I suspect we have as yet traversed only the manufacturing
part of the city, as the only buildings heretofore
visible are small dwelling-houses and manufactories.
At length we pull up in the station, and find
ourselves safely landed in Chicago.</p>

<p>Oh, the luxury of a good wash after a continuous
journey of two thousand four hundred miles by rail!
What a blessing cold water is, did we but know it.
The luxury, also, of taking off one's clothes to sleep
in a bed, after five nights' rolling about in railway
cars,&mdash;that also is a thing to be enjoyed once in a
lifetime! But, for the sake of the pleasure, I confess
I have no particular desire to repeat the process.</p>

<p>And now for the wonders of Chicago. It is really
a place worth going a long way to see. It exhibits
the enterprise of the American people in its most
striking light. Such immense blocks of buildings
forming fine broad streets, such magnificent wharves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and warehouses, such splendid shops, such handsome
churches, and such elegant public buildings! One
can scarcely believe that all this has been the work
of little more than thirty years.</p>

<p>It is true, the situation of Chicago at the head of
Lake Michigan, with a great fertile country behind it,
has done much for the place; but without the <i>men</i>,
Chicago would have been nothing. It is human industry
and energy that have made it what it is. Nothing
seems too bold or difficult for the enterprise of Chicago
men. One of their most daring but successful feats
was in altering the foundation level of the city. It
was found that the business quarter was laid too low&mdash;that
it was damp, and could not be properly drained.
It was determined to raise the whole quarter bodily
from six to eight feet higher! And the extraordinary
feat was accomplished with the help of screw-jacks,
safely and satisfactorily.</p>

<p>With the growth of population&mdash;and its increase
was most rapid (from 4000 persons in 1837 to about
350,000 at the present time)&mdash;the difficulty of obtaining
pure water steadily increased. There was pure water
enough in the lake outside, but along shore it was
so polluted by the sewage that it could not be used
with safety. Two methods were adopted to remedy
this evil. One was, to make Artesian wells 700 feet
deep, which yield about a million gallons of pure water
per day; but another, and much bolder scheme, was
undertaken, that of carrying a tunnel under the bed
of the lake, two miles out, into perfectly pure water;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and this work was successfully accomplished and completed
on the 25th of March, 1867, when the water
was let into the tunnel to flow through the pipes and
quadrants of the city. Thus 57 million gallons of
water per day could be supplied to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Another important and daring work was that involved
in carrying the traffic of the streets from one
side of the Chicago river (which flows through the
city) to the other, without the interference of bridges.
This was accomplished by means of tunnels constructed
beneath the bed of the river. The first tunnel was
carried across from Washington Street to the other
side some years since; it was arched with brick, floored
with timber, and lighted with gas. The second, lower
down the same river, was still in progress at the period
of my visit to the city in March last, and is not yet
completed. By means of these tunnels the traffic of
the streets will be sufficiently accommodated, without
any interruption by the traffic of the river,&mdash;large
ships proceeding directly up to the wharves above to
load and unload their cargoes.</p>

<p>But the boldest project of all remains to be mentioned.
It is neither more nor less than the cutting
down of the limestone ridge which intervenes between
the head-waters of the River Chicago and those of the
River Illinois, which flows into the Mississippi. The
water supply being still found insufficient, the carrying
out of a second tunnel into deep water under the bed
of the lake was projected. It then occurred to the
Chicago engineers that a more simple method would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
be, instead of going out into the lake for the pure
water, to make the pure water come to them. The
sewage-laden stream of the Chicago river now flowed
north into the lake; would it not be practicable, by
cutting down the level inland, to make it flow south,
and thus bring the pure water of the lake in an
abundant stream past their very doors?</p>

<p>This scheme has actually been carried out! The
work was in progress while I was there, and I observe
that it has since been completed. The limestone
plateau to the south of Chicago has been cut down
at a cost of about three millions of dollars; and an
abundant supply of pure water has thus been secured
to the town for ever. But the cutting of this artificial
river for the purpose of water supply has opened up
another and a much larger question. It is, whether by
sufficiently deepening the bed, a channel may not be
formed for large ocean-going ships, so that Chicago
may be placed in direct water communication with the
Gulf of Mexico, as it now is with the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Should this project, which was freely spoken
of when I was at Chicago, be carried out, it may lead
to very important consequences. While it may have
the effect of greatly promoting the prosperity of
Chicago, it may also have an altogether different
result. "The letting out of waters" is not always a
safe thing; and the turning of the stream, or any considerable
part of the stream which now passes over
the falls of Niagara, into the bed of the Mississippi&mdash;whose
swollen waters are sometimes found sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
unmanageable as it is&mdash;might have a very extraordinary
and even startling effect upon the low-lying
regions at the mouth of that great river. But this is
a point that must be left for geologists and engineers to
speculate about and to settle.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival in Chicago, I went out
for a wander in the streets. I was accompanied by
the Hotel "tout" who soon gave me his history. He
had been a captain in the English army, had run
through all his money, and come here to make more.
He had many reminiscences to relate of his huntings in
Leicestershire, of his life in the army, of his foolish
gamblings, of his ups and downs in America, and his
present prospects. Nothing daunted by his mishaps,
he was still full of hope. He was an agent for railways,
agent for a billiard-table manufacturer and for several
patents, and believed he should soon be a rich man
again. But no one, he said, had any chance in
Chicago, unless he was prepared to work, and to work
hard. "A man," he observed, "must have his eyes
peeled to make money; as for the lazy man, he hasn't
the ghost of a chance here."</p>

<p>My guide took me along the principal streets, which
were full of traffic and bustle, the men evidently intent
upon business, pushing on, looking neither to the right
hand nor the left. The streets are mostly stone-paved,
and, in spite of the heavy snow which has fallen, they
are clean and well kept. We passed the City Hall, the
Chamber of Commerce, and the Post Office&mdash;all fine
buildings. In the principal streets, the houses are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
five stories high, with handsome marble fronts. The
office of the 'Chicago Tribune,' situated at the corner
of one of the chief thoroughfares, is a splendid pile
with a spacious corner entrance. The Potter Palmer
block, chiefly occupied as a gigantic draper's shop&mdash;here
called a Dry Goods' Store&mdash;is an immense pile
of buildings, with massive marble front handsomely
carved. But the building which promises shortly
to overtop all others in Chicago, is the Pacific Hotel,
now in course of erection,&mdash;an enormous structure,
covering an acre and a half of ground, with a
frontage of 325 feet, and a height of 104 feet. It is
expected to be the largest and finest building in the
city, until something else is projected to surpass and
excel it.</p>

<p>In my progress through the streets I came upon
two huge steam cranes at work, hoisting up stuff from
a great depth below. I was told that this was the
second tunnel in course of construction underneath
the bed of the river to enable the traffic to pass across
without the necessity for bridges. The stream over
the tunnel was busy with shipping. In one street
I passed a huge pile of dead pigs in front of a sausage
shop. They go in pigs and come out sausages. Pork
is one of the great staples of the place; the number of
pigs slaughtered in Chicago being something enormous.
The pig-butcheries and pork stores are among
the largest buildings in the city. My guide assures
me that at least a pig a second is killed and dressed in
Chicago all the year through. Another street was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
occupied by large stores of grain, fruit, and produce of
all kinds. The pathways were filled with farmers and
grain brokers, settling bargains and doing business.
And yet it was not market day, when the streets are
far more crowded and full of bustle.</p>

<p>Some idea of the enormous amount of business in
grain done in Chicago may be formed from the fact
that in one year, 1868, sixty-eight million bushels of
grain were shipped from its wharves. It is the centre
of the grain trade of the States; lines of railway
concentre upon it from all parts of the interior; and,
by means of shipping, the produce is exported to the
Eastern States, to Great Britain, or to any other part
of the world where it is needed.</p>

<p>The street cars go jingling along with their heavy
loads of passengers. A continual stream of people
keeps coming and going. There are many young
ladies afoot, doing their shopping; enveloped in furs,
and some with white scarfs&mdash;or "clouds" as they
are called&mdash;round their heads. Loud advertisements,
of all colours, shapes, and sizes, abound on every side.
Pea-nut sellers at their stands on the pavement invite
the passers-by to purchase, announcing that they roast
fresh every half-hour. What amused me, in one of
the by-streets from which the frozen snow had not
been removed, was seeing a number of boys skating
along at full speed.</p>

<p>Fronting the lake is the fashionable avenue of the
city. Here, nice detached houses range along the
broad road for miles. Trees shade the carriage-way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
which in summer must look beautiful. Now all is
covered with hard-frozen snow, over which the sleigh-bells
sound merrily as the teams come dashing along.
Here comes a little cutter with a pretty black pony,
which trots saucily past, and is followed by a grand
double-seated sleigh drawn by three splendid greys.
Other sleighs, built for lightness and speed, are drawn
by fast-trotting horses, in which the Americans take so
much delight. The object of most of the young men
who are out sleighing seems to be to pass the sleigh in
front of them, so that some very smart racing is usually
to be seen along the Avenue drive.</p>

<p>As might be expected from the extent and wealth
of its population, Chicago is well supplied with places
of amusement. I observe that Christine Nilsson is
here at present, and she is an immense favourite.
There are also many handsome stone churches in
the city, which add much to the fine appearance of
the place. But I had neither time to visit the theatres
nor the churches, as my time in Chicago was already
up, and I, accordingly, made arrangements for pursuing
my journey eastward.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>For some distance out of Chicago, the railway runs
alongside the fine avenue fronting Lake Michigan.
We pass a long succession of villas amidst their gardens
and shrubberies, now white with snow and frost. Then
we cross an inlet on a timber viaduct laid on piles
driven into the bed of the lake. The ice at some parts
is thrown up irregularly in waves, and presents a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
strange aspect. It looks as if it had been frozen solid
in one moment at a time when the wind was blowing
pretty hard.</p>

<p>At another part, where the ice is smoother, men were
getting in the ice harvest between us and the shore.
The snow is first cleared from the surface by means of
a snow plane. Then the plough, drawn by a horse,
with a man guiding the sharp steel cutter, makes a
deep groove into the ice. These grooves are again
crossed by others at right angles, until the whole of
the surface intended to be gathered in is divided into
sections of about four feet square. When that is done,
several of the first blocks taken out are detached by
means of hand-saws; after which the remainder are
easily broken off with crow-bars. The blocks are then
stored in the large ice-houses on shore, several of which
are so large as to be each capable of holding some
20,000 tons of ice.</p>

<p>The consumption of ice in the States is enormous.
Every one takes ice in their water, in winter as well
as in summer. Even the commonest sort of people
consume it largely; and they send round to the store
for ten cents' worth of ice, just as our people send
round to the nearest public for six penny worth of beer.
I have heard Americans who have been in London
complain of the scarcity of ice with us, and the parsimonious
way in which it is used. But then we have
not the enormous natural stores of ice close to our
doors, as they have at Chicago and many other of the
large American towns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile we have skirted the shores of the lake,
and shot into the country, the snow lying deep in the
fields, in some places quite covering the tops of the
fences. After passing through a rather thickly-wooded
country, we came to Michigan city, which stands close
to the lake, with a river flowing past it, on which
large barges piled high with timber are now completely
frozen up. What a pretty place this Michigan must
be in summer time, when the trees which line the
streets, and all the shady gardens about it, are clad
in green. Even now the town has a brisk, cheerful
look. The sleighs are running merrily over the snow,
and the omnibuses glide smoothly along the streets on
their "runners."</p>

<p>Taking one last look of the great inland sea, we
struck across the broad peninsula formed by Lake
Michigan on one side and Lake Huron on the other,
to the town of Detroit. The country was very thickly
wooded in some places,&mdash;apparently the remains of the
old primeval forest. Yet there were towns and villages
at frequent intervals along the route. The deer have
not yet been extirpated, for often and again I saw their
tracks in the snow along the banks of the railway.</p>

<p>At one part of the road the speed of the train
slackened, and the engine moved along slowly, whistling
as it went. What was wrong? I got out on to the
platform to see. We soon came up to a smashed train;
frames of cars, wrecks of cases, wheels, axles, and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>,
lying promiscuously tumbled together. I asked the
conductor what had happened? He answered quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
coolly, "Guess the express ran into the goods train!"
It looked very much like it!</p>

<p>In the course of the day we passed several small
manufacturing towns. It seemed so odd, when we
appeared as if travelling through the back woods, to
see above the trees, not far off, a tall red chimney,
where not long before we had passed the track of the
wild deer. There was one very large manufactory&mdash;so
large that it had a special branch to itself connecting
it with the main track&mdash;at a place called Kalamazoo,
reminding one of Red Indians and war trails over this
ground not so very long ago. The town of Kalamazoo
itself is a large and busy place: who knows but that
it may contain the embryo of some future Leeds or
Manchester?</p>

<p>It was dark when the train reached Detroit, where
we had to cross the river which runs between Lake
St. Clair and Lake Erie by ferry-boat into Canada. The
street being dark, I missed my way, and at last found
myself on the edge of the water when I least expected
it. I got on board just as the last bell was sounding
before the boat put off from the quay. I then had
my baggage checked on to Niagara, a custom-house
officer on board marking all the pieces intended only
to pass through Canada, thereby avoiding examination.
All the arrangements of the American railways
with respect to luggage seem to me excellent, and calculated
greatly to promote the convenience of the
travelling public.</p>

<p>We were not more than a quarter of an hour on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
board the ferry-boat, during which I found time to
lay in a good supper in the splendid saloon occupying
the upper story of the vessel. Arrived at the Canadian
side, there was a general rush to the train; and the
carriages were soon filled. There were great complaints
amongst some of the passengers that the Pullman's
cars were all full, and that no beds were to
be had; there being usually a considerable run upon
these convenient berths, especially in the depth of
winter.</p>

<p>My next neighbour during the night was a very
pleasant gentleman&mdash;an American. I must here confess
to the agreeable disappointment I have experienced
with respect to the Americans I have hitherto
come in contact with. I have as yet met with no
specimens of the typical Yankee depicted by satirists
and novelists. In my innocence I expected to be asked
in the cars such questions as "I guess you're a Britisher,
Sir?" "Where do you come from, Stranger?"
"Where are you going to, Sir?" "What are you going
to do when you get there?" and such like. It is true
that at San Francisco I encountered a few of such
questions, but the persons who put them were for the
most part only hotel touters. Among the Americans
of about my own condition with whom I travelled,
I met with nothing but politeness and civility. I will
go further, and say that the generality of Americans
are more ready to volunteer a kindness than is usual
in England. They are always ready to answer a
question, to offer a paper, to share a rug, or perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
tender a cigar. They are generally easy in manner,
yet unobtrusive. I will also add, that so far as my
experience goes, the average intelligence of young
men in America is considerably higher than it is in
England. They are better educated and better informed;
and I met few or none who were not able
to enter into any topic of general conversation, and
pursue it pleasantly.</p>

<p>I saw but little of Canada, for I passed through
what is called the "London district" of it in the
night. It was about four in the morning when the
train reached the suspension bridge which crosses from
Canada into the States, about a mile and a half below
the Falls of Niagara. We were soon upon the bridge,&mdash;a
light, airy-looking structure, made principally of
strong wire,&mdash;and I was out upon the carriage platform,
looking down into the gorge below. It was
bright moonlight, so that I could see well about me.
There were the snow-covered cliffs on either side, and
the wide rift between them two hundred and fifty feet
deep, in the bottom of which ran the river at a speed
of about thirty miles an hour. It almost made the
head dizzy to look down. But we were soon across
the bridge, and on solid land again. We were already
within hearing of the great roar of the Falls, not
unlike the sound of an express train coming along the
track a little distance of. Shortly after, we reached
our terminus and its adjoining hotel, in which for a
time I forgot the Falls and everything else in a sound
sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing that struck me on wakening was
the loud continuous roar near at hand. I was soon
up and out, and on my way to the Falls, seated in
a grand sleigh drawn by a pair of fine black horses.
Remember it was the dead of winter, the fifteenth of
February, not by any means the time of the year for
going about sight-seeing; and yet I fancy the sight
of Niagara in mid-winter must be quite as astonishing,
and perhaps even more picturesque, than at any other
season.</p>

<p>Over the crisp snow, and through the clean little
town, the sleigh went flying, the roar of the water
growing louder as we neared the Falls. Soon we are
at the gates of a bridge, where a toll is charged for
admission to the island from which the great Falls
are best seen. Crossing the bridge, we reach the small
island, on which a large paper mill has been erected;
and I am pointed to a rock to which last winter a poor
fellow&mdash;beyond the reach of safety, though in sight&mdash;clung
for hours, until, unable to hold on any longer,
he was finally swept away down the torrent.</p>

<p>We cross another small bridge, and are on the celebrated
Goat Island, which divides the great Canadian
from the smaller American fall. My driver first took
me to a point on the American side of this island,
from which a fine view is to be obtained. The sight
is certainly most wonderful. I walked down a steep
pathway slippery with ice, with steps cut here and
there in the rock, and suddenly found myself on the
brink of the precipice. Close to my left, the water was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
pouring down into a chasm a hundred and sixty
feet below, disappearing in a great blue cavern of
ice that seemed to swallow it up. By the continual
freezing of the spray, this great ice-cave reaches higher
and higher during winter time. Immense icicles, some
fifty feet long, hang down the sides of the rock immediately
over the precipice. The trees on the island
above were bent down with the weight of the frozen
spray, which hung in masses from their branches. The
blending of the ice and water far beneath my feet was
a remarkable sight. As the spray and mist from time
to time cleared off, I looked deep down into the dark
icy abyss, in which the water roared, and foamed, and
frothed, and boiled again.</p>

<p>Then I went to the other side of the island, quite
fairy-like as it glistened in the sunlight, gemmed with
ice-drops, and clad in its garment of white. And there
I saw that astounding sight, the great Horse-shoe Fall,
seven hundred feet across, over which the enormous
mass of water pours with tremendous force. As the
water rolled over the cliff, it seemed to hang like
a green curtain in front of it, until it reached half-way
down; then gradually breaking, white streaks appeared
in it, broadening as they descended, until at length the
mighty mass sprouted in foam, and fell roaring into
the terrific gulf some hundred and fifty feet below.
A great ice bridge stretched across the river beyond
the boiling water at the bottom of the Fall, rough and
uneven like some of the Swiss glaciers. Clouds of
spray flew about, seemingly like smoke or steam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Words fail to describe a scene of such overpowering
grandeur as this.</p>

<p>I was next driven along Goat Island to a small
suspension bridge, some distance above the Falls, where
I crossed over to one of the three Sister Islands&mdash;small
bits of land jutting right out into the middle
of the rapids. The water passes between each of
these islands. I went out to the extreme point of the
furthest. The sight here is perhaps second only to
the great Fall itself. The river, about a mile and
a quarter wide, rushes down the heavy descent, contracting
as it goes, before leaping the precipice below.
The water was tossing and foaming like an angry sea,
reminding me of the ocean when the waves are
running high and curling their white crests after
a storm.</p>

<p>These rapids had far more fascination for me than
the Falls themselves. I could sit and watch for hours
the water rushing past; and it was long before I could
leave them, though my feet were in deep snow. It
must be very fine to sit out at that extreme point
in summer time, shaded by the rich foliage of the
trees, and dream away the hours. The seat is known
as the Lovers' seat, but lovers would need to have
strong lungs to shout their whispers to each other
there, if they wished them to be heard.</p>

<p>At length I turned my back upon the foaming
torrent, and resumed the road to my hotel. On my
way back, I stopped at the genuine Niagara curiosity-shop,
where photographs, Indian bead and feather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
work, and articles manufactured out of the "real
Niagara spar," are sold. Only the photographs are
really genuine and good. The bead-work is a manufacture,
and probably never passed through Indian
hands; while the Niagara spar is imported from Matlock,
much of it doubtless returning to England in
the form of curious specimens of workmanship from
the Great Falls.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have very little more to add relating to my journey
through the States. I was not making a tour, but
passing through America at railway speed on my way
home to England; and I have merely described, in the
most rapid and cursory way, the things that struck me
along my route. All that remained for me to do between
Niagara and New York, was to call at Rochester,
and pay an unheralded visit to my American cousins
there. What English family has not got relations in the
States? I find that I have them living in Rochester,
Boston, and St. Louis. It is the same blood, after all,
in both countries&mdash;in Old and New England.</p>

<p>After travelling through the well-cultivated, well-peopled
country that extends eastward from Niagara
to Rochester, I arrived at my destination about four in
the afternoon, and immediately went in search of my
American cousins. I was conscious of being a rather
untidy sight to look at, after my long railway journey
of nearly three thousand miles, and did not know
what, in my rough travelling guise, my reception
might be. But any misgivings on that point were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
soon set at rest by the cordiality of my reception.
I was at once made one of the family, and treated as
such. I enjoyed with my new-found relatives four
delightful days of recruiting rest and friendly intercourse.
To use the common American phrase, I had
a "real good time."</p>

<p>The town of Rochester is much bigger than the
English city of the same name. It is a place of
considerable trade and importance, with a population
of about 60,000. Some of the commercial buildings
are very fine; and I was told of one place, that it
was "the finest fire-proof establishment in the world."
Possibly the American world was meant, and that is by
no means a small one. Rochester is especially famous
for its nurseries, where trees of all kinds are reared
and sent far and near; its principal nursery firms
being known all over Europe.</p>

<p>There are some fine waterfalls near Rochester&mdash;the
falls of the Genesee. Had I not seen Niagara, I should
have doubtless wondered at their beauty. Their height
is as great, but the quantity of water is wanting.
After Niagara, all other falls must seem comparatively
tame.</p>

<p>My short stay in Rochester was made most pleasant.
I felt completely at home and at my ease in the
American household I had so suddenly entered. I also
accompanied my cousins to two evening entertainments,
one a fancy dress ball, and the other a <i>soir&eacute;e dansante</i>,
where I made the passing acquaintance of some very
agreeable American ladies and gentlemen. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
really sorry to leave Rochester; and as the carriage
drove me along the pretty avenue to the station, I felt
as if I were just leaving a newly-found home.</p>

<p>I travelled from Rochester to New York during the
night, passing several large towns, and at some places
iron-furnaces at work, reminding one of the "Black
country" in England by night. The noble Hudson
was hard bound in ice as we passed along its banks,
so that I missed the beautiful sight that it presents in
summer time. But it is unnecessary for me to dwell
either upon the Hudson or the city of New York,
about which most people are in these days well read
up. As for New York, I cannot say that I was particularly
struck by it, except by its situation, which is
superb, and by its magnitude, which is immense. It
seemed to me only a greater Manchester, with larger
signboards, a clearer atmosphere, and a magnificent river
front. It contains no great buildings of a metropolitan
character, unless amongst such buildings are to be
included hotels, newspaper offices, and dry goods
stores, some of which are really enormous piles.
Generally speaking, New York may be described as
a city consisting of comparatively insignificant parts
greatly exaggerated, and almost infinitely multiplied.
It may be want of taste; but on the whole, I was
better pleased with Chicago. The season of my visit
was doubtless unpropitious. Who could admire the
beauties of the noble Central Park in the dead of
winter? Perhaps, too, I was not in a good humour to
judge of New York, as it was there that I met with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
my first and only misfortune during my two years'
absence from home. For there I was robbed.</p>

<p>I had been strongly urged by my friends at Rochester
to go to Booth's Theatre to see Mr. Booth play in
'Richelieu,' as a thing not to be seen in the same
perfection anywhere else. I went accordingly, enjoyed
Booth's admirable acting, and returned to my hotel.
When I reached there, on feeling my pocket, lo! my
purse was gone! I had been relieved of it either
in the press at the theatre exit, or in entering or
leaving the tramway car on my return.</p>

<p>I had my ticket for Liverpool safe in my waistcoat
pocket; but there was my hotel bill to pay, and
several necessaries to purchase for use during the
voyage home. What was I to do? I knew nobody in
New York. It was too far from home to obtain a
remittance from thence, and I was anxious to leave
without further delay. I bethought me of the kind
friends I had left at Rochester, acquainted them with
my misfortune, and asked for a temporary loan of
twenty dollars. By return post an order arrived for
a hundred. "A friend in need is a friend indeed."</p>

<p>The same post brought two letters from my Rochester
friends, in one of which my correspondent said that
my misfortune was one that few escaped in New York.
He himself had been robbed of his purse in a Broadway
stage; his father had been robbed of a pocket-book
containing money; and his father-in-law of a
gold watch. My other kind correspondent, who enclosed
me his cheque, said, by way of caution, "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
must bear in mind that the principal streets of New
York are full of pickpockets and desperadoes. They
will recognize you as a stranger, so you must be wary.
You may be 'spotted' as you go into or come out of the
banking office. It often happens that a man is robbed
in Wall Street in open day,&mdash;is knocked down and his
money 'grabbed' before his eyes. So be very careful
and trust nobody. Go alone to the banking office, or
get a trusty servant from the house to go with you.
But let no outsider see cheque or money."</p>

<p>Of course I took very good care not to be robbed in
New York a second time, and I got away from it
in safety next morning by the 'City of Brooklyn,'
taking with me the above very disagreeable reminiscence
of my New York experience. It is not necessary
to describe the voyage home,&mdash;the passage from
New York to Liverpool being now as familiar an event
as the journey from London to York. At Queenstown
I telegraphed my arrival to friends at home, and by
the time the ship entered the Mersey there were
those waiting at the landing-place to give me a cordial
welcome back. I ran up to town by the evening train,
and was again at home. Thus I completed my Voyage
Round the World, in the course of which I have
gained health, knowledge, and experience, and seen
and learnt many things which will probably furnish
me with matter for thought in all my future life.</p>
